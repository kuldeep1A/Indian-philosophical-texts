b'1.1 Dhritarashtra said What did my people and the sons of Pandu do when they had assembled together eager for battle on the holy plain of Kurukshetra, O Sanjaya. '
b'1.2. Sanjaya said  Having seen the army of the Pandavas drawn up in battle-array,\nKing Duryodhana then approached his teacher (Drona) and spoke these words.\n\n'
b'1.3. "Behold, O Teacher! this mighty army of the sons of Pandu,\narrayed by the son of Drupada, thy wise disciple.\n\n'
b'1.4. Here are heroes, mighty archers, eal in battle to Bhima\nand Arjuna, Yoyudhana (Satyaki), Virata and Drupada, of the great car (mighty\nwarriors).\n\n'
b'1.5. "Dhrishtaketu, chekitana and the valiant king of Kasi, Purujit\nand Kuntibhoja and Saibya, the best men.\n\n'
b'1.6. "The strong Yodhamanyu and the brave Uttamaujas, the son\nof Subhadra (Abhimanyu, the son of Subhadra and Arjuna), and the sons of\nDraupadi, all of great chariots (great heroes).\n\n'
b'1.7. "Know also, O best among the twice-born! the names of those\nwho are the most distinguished amongst ourselves, the leaders of my army;\nthese I name to thee for thy information.\n\n'
b'1.8. "Thyself and Bhishma, and Karna and also Kripa, the victorious\nin war, Asvatthama, Vikarna, and also Bhurisrava, the son of Somadatta.\n\n'
b'1.9. "And also many other heroes who are ready to give up their\nlives for my sake, armed with various weapons and missiles, all well-skilled\nin battle.\n\n'
b'1.10. "This army of ours marshalled by Bhishma is insufficient,\nwhereas that army of theirs marshelled by Bhima is sufficient.\n\n'
b'1.11. "Therefore do ye all, stationed in your respective positions,\nin the several divisions of the army, protect Bhishma alone."\n\n'
b'1.12. His glorious grandsire (Bhishma), the oldest of the Kauravas,\nin order to cheer Duryodhana, now roared like a lion, and blew his conch.\n\n'
b'1.13. Then (following Bhishma), conches and kettledrums, tabors,\ndrums and cow horns blared forth ite suddenly (from the Kaurava side)\nand the sound was tremendous.\n\n'
b'1.14. Then, also, Madhava (Krishna) and the son of Pandu (Arjuna),\nseated in the magnificent chariot, yoked with white horses, blew divine\nconches.\n\n'
b'1.15. Hrishikesha blew the Panchajanya and Arjuna blew the Devadatta\nand Bhima (the wolf-bellied), the doer of terrible deeds, blew the great\nconch Paundra.\n\n'
b'1.16. The king Yodhishthira, the son of Kunti, blew the Anantavijaya;\nNakula and Sahadeva blew the Sughosha and the Manipushpaka.\n\n'
b'1.17. The king of Kasi, an exellent archer, Sikhandi, the mighty\ncar-warrior, Dhrishtadyumna and Virata and Satyaki, the unconered.\n\n'
b'1.18. Drupada and the sons of Draupadi, O Lord of the earth, and\nthe son of Subhadra, the mighty-armed, blew their conches separately.\n\n'
b"1.19. That tumultuous sound rent the hearts of (the members of)\nDhritarashtra's party, making both the heaven and the earth resound.\n\n"
b'1.20. Then, seeing the people of Dhritarashtra\xe2\x80\x99s party standing\narrayed and the discharge of weapons about to begin, Arjuna, the son of\nPandu, whose ensign was a monkey, took up his bow and said the following\nto Krishna, O Lord of the earth.\n\n'
b'1.21 Arjuna said  In the middle between the two armies, place my chariot,\nO krishna, so that I may behold those who stand here desirous to fight,\nand know with whom I must fight, when the battle is about to commence.\n\n'
b'1.22. Arjuna said  In the middle between the two armies, place my chariot,\nO krishna, so that I may behold those who stand here desirous to fight,\nand know with whom I must fight, when the battle is about to commence.\n\n'
b'1.23. For I desire to observe those who are assembled here to fight,\nwishing to please in battle the evil-minded Duryodhana (the son of Dhritarashtra).\n\n'
b'1.24. Sanjaya said  Thus addressed by Arjuna, Krishna, having stationed that\nbest of chariots, O Dhritarashtra, in the midst of the two armies.\n\n'
b'1.25. In front of Bhishma and Drona, and all the rulers of the\nearth, said: "O Arjuna (son of Pritha), behold these Kurus gathered together."\n\n'
b'1.26. Then, Arjuna (son of Pritha) saw there (in the armies) stationed,\nfathers and grandfathers, teachers, maternal uncles, brothers, sons, grandsons\nand friends too.\n\n'
b'1.27. (He saw) fathers-in-law and friends also in both the armies.\nThe son of Kunti, Arjuna, seeing all those kinsmen thus standing arrayed,\nspoke this, sorrowfully filled with deep pity.\n\n'
b'1.28. Arjuna said  Seeing these, my kinsmen, O krishna, arrayed, eager to fight.\n\n'
b'1.29. My limbs fail and my mouth is parched, my body ivers and\nmy hair stands on end.\n\n'
b'1.30. The (bow) Gandiva slips from my hand, and also my skins burns\nall over; I am unable even to stand and my mind is reeling, as it were.\n\n'
b'1.31. And I see adverse omens, O Kesava. I do not see any good\nin killing my kinsmen in battle.\n\n'
b'1.32. I desire not victory, O Krishna, nor kingdom, nor pleasures.\nOf what avail is dominion to us, O Krishna, or pleasures or even life?\n\n'
b'1.33. Those for whose sake we desire kingdom, enjoyments and pleasures,\nstand here in battle, having renounced life and wealth.\n\n'
b'1.34. Teachers, fathers, sons and also grandfathers, maternal uncles,\nfathers-in-law, grandsons, brothers-in-law and other relatives,-\n\n'
b'1.35. These I do not wish to kill, though they kill me, O Krishna,\neven for the sake of dominion over the three worlds; leave alone killing\nthem for the sake of the earth.\n\n'
b'1.36. By killing these sons of Dhritarashtra, what pleasure can\nbe ours, O Janardana? Only sin will accrue to us from killing these felons.\n\n'
b'1.37. Therefore, we should not kill the sons of Dhritarashtra,\nour relatives; for how can we be happy by killing our own people, O Madhava\n(Krishna)?\n\n'
b'1.38. Though they, with intelligence overpowered by greed, see\nno evil in the destruction of families, and no sin in hostility to friends,\n\n'
b'1.39. Why should not we who clearly see evil in the destruction\nof families, learn to turn away from this sin, O Janardana (Krishna)?\n\n'
b'1.40. In the destruction of a family, the immemorial religious\nrites of that family perish; on the destruction of spirituality, impiety,\nindeed, overcomes the whole family.\n\n'
b'1.41. By the prevalence of impiety, O Krishna, the women of\nthe family become corrupt; and , women being corrupted, O Varshenya (descendant\nof Vrishni), there arises intermingling of castes.\n\n'
b'1.42. Confusion of castes leads to hell the slayers of the family,\nfor their forefathers fall, deprived of the offerings of rice-ball and\nwater (libations).\n\n'
b'1.43. By these evil deeds of the destroyers of the family, which\ncause confusion of castes, the eternal religious rites of the caste and\nthe family are destroyed.\n\n'
b'1.44. We have heard, O Janardana, that inevitable is the dwelling\nfor an unknown period in hell for those men in whose families the religious\npractices have been destroyed.\n\n'
b'1.45. Alas! We are involved in a great sin, in that we are\nprepared to kill our kinsmen, through greed for the pleasures of a kingdom.\n\n'
b'1.46. If the sons of Dhritarashtra with weapons in hand should\nslay me in battle, unresisting and unarmed, that would be better for me.\n\n'
b'1.47. Sanjaya said  Having thus spoken in the midst of the battlefield, Arjuna,\ncasting away his bow and arrow, sat down on the seat of the chariot with\nhis mind overwhelmed with sorrow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n'
