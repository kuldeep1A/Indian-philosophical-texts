You alone should  be the king (meaning that when the elder brother is alive, the younger brother is prohibited from ruling the kingdom)'."

'Although a source of universal delight, although exceedingly generous and of cheerful countenance, highly renowned and capable Rama refused to accept the kingdom in accordance with the command of his father.'

"Then Rama vowed to slay Vali. The monkey (Sugriva) described about Vali's prowess to Rama."

'Doubtful of the prowess Sugriva of Rama Sugriva inorder to get convinced showed him the huge (dead) body of Dundubhi resembling a big mountain.'

'The heroic Hanuman came to know that he could be released from the entanglements of the weapon granted to him through a boon by Brahma. He allowed himself to be restrained by the rakshasas with the ropes for the sake of achieving his other objective of seeing Ravana. Thereafter, he burnt the whole of Lanka except the place where Sita was and returned to deliver the good news to Rama.'

'Reaching Rama the great Hanuman gifted with boundless intellect circumambulated him and infact informed him that he had seen Sita.'

'Thereafter, Rama reached the shore of the ocean together with Sugriva and saw the ocean agitated with shafts burning like the Sun.'

'"O Bharadwaja, behold the beautiful and pleasant waters of this river. This holy spot  is as clear and pure as the mind of a virtuous man.'

'O dear one Put down the pitcher on the ground. Give me my garment. I shall take a dip in Tamasa, the holiest of places". '

'Asked thus by the nobleminded master Valmiki, Bharadwaja, ever obedient to his spiritual master, gave the sage the bark garment.'

'Valmiki who had his senses under his command received the barkgarment from the hands of his disciple and wandered about in that extensive forest, looking all around.'

'A sinful and cruelhearted hunter struck down the male bird of the pair in his very  presence.'

'The female companion saw the male bird struck down by the hunter and rolling on the earth, drenched in blood. Separated from her winged comparion with coppercrested head intoxicated with her love, the female companion lifted a piteous wail. '

'Having heard the wailing of the female bird, the sage (Valmiki) moved to pity at this irreligious act uttered the following words.'

'"O fowler, since you have killed one of the pair of infatuated kraunchas you will be permanently deprived of your position".'

"Brooding over his utterances, he reflected, 'What is this that I uttered in reaction to the grief of this bird?'"

'Very wise and learned, he (Valmiki), preeminent among sages, pondered over it (for a while) and spoke these words to his disciple.'

'"Occasioned by the griefstricken (state of the bird) and composed in rhymed lines each of equal number of syllables tuned to the accompaniment of stringed instruments, let it be known as a sloka and not by any other name".'

'His disciple, delighted by the excellent verse composed by the sage, committed it to memory which left his spiritual preceptor pleased. '

'Lord Brahma sat down on a highly worshipful seat and showed a seat for the  ascetic Valmiki to be seated.'

'Having been ordered by Brahma, he also sat down on a seat. Although seated in the presence of the lord of the worlds, he was absorbed in the thought of events (leading to the death of the krauncha ).'

'The hunter killed the sweetvoiced krauncha without any cause. That sinfulminded one with hostile feeling of capturing it, had perpetrated this cruel act, he thought.'

'Griefstricken, Valmiki having become introspective and lamenting the plight of the female krauncha  again and again, recited this sloka.'

'Thereafter lord Brahma smilingly addressed Valmiki, the preeminent among sages, saying, "You have indeed composed a sloka.There is no doubt about it".'

'"OBrahmarshi, at my will, this speech had originated from you. Most excellent ascetic, compose the history of Rama in its entirety (in this metre).'

'Then Vasishta, having summoned Sumantra said to him "Invite all the righteous kings on earth".'

'"Extend an honourable invitation to brahmins, kshatriyas, merchants and sudras in their thousands residing in all countries.'

'You may personally go and bring with due honour king Janaka who is the distinguished king of Mithila, a warrior whose truth is his strength proficient in all scriptures and the Vedas. Since he is an old ally, I am telling you in advance.'

'Similarly, you may personally escort king of Kasi who is always affectionate and sweettongued. He is a friend to our king who is a lion among rulers.'

"In accordance with the ascetic's order, righteous Sumantra himself quickly set out to escort Janaka and other kings."

'All the workers reported to the wise sage, Vasishta about the tasks completed for the sacrifice.  '

'Then, well pleased, the best among brahmins (Vasishta) said to them all "Nobody should be offered any thing with disregard. Anything given with contempt undoubtedly  results in the destruction of the donor."'

'Meanwhile kings from several countries to travelling nights and days arrived bringing with them various kinds of (precious) gifts.'

'Thereupon, wellpleased, Vasishta addressing Dasaratha said "O best among men, beacuse of your command, kings from various countries have arrived. I have extended due hospitality to those noble kings according to their station."'

'"O king, persons with composed minds have made preparations for the yaga. Now be pleased to leave for sacrificial altar nearby to perform yaga.'

'O foremost of kings, you ought to see the sacrificial ground full of sources of entertainment arranged everywhere, as though improvised by imagination".'

'O best of men give us gems or gold or cows or whichever is readily available. We have no use with this earth".'

'Rsyasringa, a highly  intellectual and knowledgeable one in the Vedas, pondered for a while, revived his memory  and said to the king.'

'"I shall perform putriyeshti to help you beget sons. This is to be done in accordance with tradition for fulfilment of desires through mantras as declared in a portion of the Vedas, \'atharva siras\'" .'

' ', 'To help Dasaratha beget sons, brilliant Rsyasringa  commenced putriyeshti, a sacrifice for begetting children, by pouring oblations into sacrificial fire and chanting mantras in accordance with traditions. '

'All the celestial deities etc., along with gandharvas according to tradition, gathered at the sacrifice to receive their share of offerings.'

'All devatas assembled there as per tradition and thus addressed Lord Brahma the creator of the worlds:'

'"O lord a rakshasa by name Ravana who had obtained prowess through your grace is oppressing us. We are unable to punish him.'

'Pleased with his penance, Lord, you had granted him a boon. By honour that boon and daily endure all his cruelty.'

'The evilminded Ravana is inflicting pains on the three worlds. He hates the guardians of the earth and intends to assault Indra, lord of the celestials.'

' ', 'Because of your boon he has become unassailable and puffed with pride deties sages, yakshas, gandharvas, demons and brahmins.'

'The Sun does not scorch him  and the wind does not blow by him. Even the ocean with its incessantly moving waves becomes still in his presence. '

' ', 'His dreamful appearance of that rakshasa strikes terror into us. O Lord do find some means to kill him".'

'After listening to the words of the devatas and reflecting over the matter, Brahma said,    "Oh, the means of destruction of that wicked (rakshasa) has struck my mind". '

'When he asked gandharvas, yakshas, gods, demons or rakshasas should never be able to kill him, I said, "So be it".'

' ', '"The rakshasa did not include man monkey and bear because of his disdain for men. As such he is fit to be destroyed by a man and not by any other means".'

' ', 'Having heard these pleasing words uttered by Brahma, all the devatas and maharshis were overwhelmed with joy.'

' ', 'At this juncture Visnu the lord of the world, highly effulgent and bearing conch, discus and mace in his hands and in yellow apparel arrived.'

' ', 'Lord Visnu stayed there with a composed mind after meeting Brahma Then thus spoke the devatas prostrated before Visnu and paying him homage with hymns.'

' ', '"O Visnu we pray for the welfare of all the worlds. The sovereign of Ayodhya, king Dasaratha is a righteous, virtuous and  generous king equal with rishis in lusture. Pray form into four and incarnate in the of four sons of his three wives, resembling hri (modesty), shree (auspiciousness), kirti (fame).'

'"O Visnu assuring human form, kill Ravana in the battle. He has become a source of torment to the worlds and is invincible by gods.'

' ', '"That stupid rakshasa, Ravana, with his haughty prowess, is terrorising the gods, gandharvas, siddhas and great rishis.'

' ', 'It is reported that a cruel rakshasa with his haughty prowess has tortured rishis, gandharvas and apsaras sporting in Nandana groves.'

' ', 'We siddhas, gandharvas and yakshas along with ascetics, have hence come here to devise ways of his death. We take refuge in you.'

'O tormentor of enemies, O Visnu, you are the supreme, refuge for all of us. Resolve to be born in the world of men for the destruction of enemies of the gods (rakshasas)".'

'Visnu, the lord of the celestials, foremost among the gods and bowed by all in the worlds addressed the assembled devatas who were guided by the law of righteousness and were led by the grand sire, Brahma.'

' '

' ', 'Lord Visnu, supreme soul having given boon to devatas in this manner, reflected as to the place where he should take birth as a man in this world of men.'

' ', 'Thereafter, the Lord with eyes like the lotus petal was pleased to transform himself into four forms and to choose king Dasaratha as his father.'

"Then along with gandharvas, groups of apsaras, rishis, rudras and devatas sang in praise of the 'Lord Slayer of Madhu', with hymns of celestial beauty. "

'"Therefore, uproot that mighty Ravana possessing frightful prowess, inflamed pride, limitless insolence causing agony to the three worlds, a source of vexation to ascetics and  a dreadful enemy of Indra.'

'Kill Ravana, the cause of distress in the worlds, kill his forces and relatives. Them return to heaven  protected by Indra after freeing from distress, faults and sins".', 'इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये बालकाण्डे पञ्चदशस्सर्ग:।।', 'Thus ends the fifteenth sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.'

'Although Omniscient lord Narayana knew the means to be employed, when he was requested by the best of devatas he spoke to them softly:'

'"What strategies should be adopted in the matter of destruction of that evilminded Ravana who is a thorn to the sages?".'

'When the devatas were thus addressed by the imperishable Visnu, they replied him saying, "You may assume the form of a human being and slay Ravana in the battle".'

'"O destroyer of foes Lord Brahma was very pleased with Ravana\'s intense penance over a long time৷৷'

'Pleased, with the rakshasa Brahma granted a boon to the effect that except from men, there was, for him, no fear of death from any other living beings. Ravana ignored men while seeking the boon.'

'Having obtained the boon from Brahma, Ravana, greed and arrogant went on bringing  destruction to the three worlds. He carried away women by violence. O destroyer of foes his death is possible by men only."'

'Having heard the words of devatas, selfpossessed Visnu chose king Dasaratha as his father.'

'At that time, the brilliant king (Dasaratha), destroyer of enemies, who had no sons was performing a sacrifice for sons. '

' ', 'After Visnu had decided (to incarnate) and he was worshipped by devatas and maharshis he disappeared bidding farewell to Brahma. '

'During the sacrifice, there emerged from the sacrificial fire a mighty being with unmatched splendour, his prowess and strength. He wore a black and crimson garment. He had a red face. His voice was similar to the sounds of a drum. He had whiskers of soft and shining tawny hair resembling the mane of a lion He had fine hair on his head. He was endowed with auspicious signs and adorned with splendid divine ornaments. His height resembled a mountain peak. He walked with the strides of a ferocious tiger. Similar to the Sun in radiance, he looked like the crest of a blazing fire. This divine being held like his beloved wife both hands, a large vessel made of gold purified, in fire, covered with a silver lid and filled with payasam (a preparation of rice in milk and sugar). It looked as though it was created  by magic. '

'Having seen king Dasaratha, he said, "O King you know I have been sent by Prjapati (Brahma), and I am here".'

'With folded palms the king replied, "O revered lord. Welcome to you. What can I do ', 'for you?".'

' ', 'Thereafter the one who came from Prajapati answered, "O King you have obtained this payasam today in return for the worship offered to the devatas".'

'"O Lion among kings, receive this payasam prepared by gods, conferring progeny, bestowing affluence and improving health. '

'O King you are performing this sacrifice for the sake of sons. Give this to your  worthy consorts to consume it. They will bear you sons". '

'Dasaratha was pleased to receive respectfully the golden vessel filled with the payasam  prepared and bestowed by devatas. '

'Overwhelmed with great joy, he, walked around that wonderful being of pleasant  countenance again and again and saluated him respectfully.'

'Dasaratha who received the payasam prepared by devatas was highly pleased like a poor man who received wealth.'

'Then that effulgent figure of wonderful form having given the bowl of payasam vanished from there.'

'The inner apartment, brightened with rays of happiness, shone like the autumnal sky in the glow of the moon.'

'He entered the inner apartment and addressing queen Kausalya said, "Receive this payasam which has the power to give you sons".'

'Then Dasaratha gave half the portion of payasam to Kausalya, half of the remaining half to Sumitra, half of the remaining portion (oneeighth of original) to Kaikeyi for the sake of a son. On further thinking, he gave the remaining oneeighth portion to Sumitra. In this manner the king divided and distributed the payasam among his wives separately.'

'The virtuous wives of the king were exceedingly delighted and felt honoured after receiving the payasam .'

'Then the excellent consorts of the king who glowed like fire and the Sun, having consumed the choicest payasam, became pregnant in a short time.'

'The king now regained his composure of mind on seeing his pregnant wives. He looked delighted like Visnu worshipped by Indra, and hosts of siddhas and rishis.', 'इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये बालकाण्डे षोडशस्सर्ग:।।', 'Thus ends the sixteenth sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic ', 'composed by sage Valmiki.'

'When Visnu had decided to be born as the son of that great king (Dasaratha), the selfborn Lord (Brahma), addressed all devatas :'

'Create strong and powerful beings capable of assuming forms at free will to extend support to Visnu who is  true to his word, heroic and benevolent.'

'Incarnate as monkeys in the womb of  chiefs of apsarasas and gandharvas. Create sons who have the knowledge of deceitful tricks, who are brave, who match wind in speed, who are endowed with intellect and statecraft, who are determined, who are  knowledgeable in various means of achieving victory, who are supernatural  bodies, who possess capability of employing and resisting weapons, who resemble those who subsist on amrita (immortals) and are equal (to Visnu) in prowess.'

'O Tiger among kings I shall unfold the purpose conceived in my mind. Take a decision and be truthful to your promise.'

'O best among men for the successful completion of a sacrifice I took up a selfimposed  religious observance. Two rakshasas, capable of assuming forms at will, are creating impediments to that sacrifice.'

'When my sacrifice generally speaking, is nearing completion the powerful and welltrained Maricha and Subahu who are raining streams of blood and flesh upon the altar.'

'The (solemn) vow for observance of religious rites being thus interrupted, I left that country as an exerted and discouraged man.'

'O King my mind does not permit me to vent my wrath. The nature of sacrifice is such that I refrain from cursing them.'

'O tiger among kings it is befitting of you to entrust your eldest son Rama to me who is valiant, young (having sidelocks of hair) and true to his prowess.'

'Protected by me and by his own divine power, Rama is capable of destroying even those demons causing impediments to the sacrifice.'

'I will confer upon him, without doubt, a lot of blessings for his wellbeing by which he will attain fame in all the three worlds.'

'Both of them (Maricha and Subahu) will not be able to withstand Rama in any way. Rama, and Rama alone, is capable of destroying them.'

'Proud of their strength, the two wicked demons have been noosed by Yama, the god of death. O tiger among kings they are no match for the magnanimous Rama.'

'"O king it is not proper for you to hesitate because of your paternal affection. You need to know that both the rakshasas will perish. This, I assure you.'

'I know Rama who is a great soul, true to his prowess and also Vasishta of great lustre and these other sages who have been steadfast in asceticism also know.'

'O king of kings, if you are seeking the benefits of righteousness, great everlasting ', 'fame in this world, it is fit and proper to give Rama to me.'

' ', 'After speaking these words charged with dharma and artha the great sage resplendent Viswamitra fell silent. '

'Having listened to those auspicious words of Viswamitra, the king among kings, (Dasaratha) experienced intense grief out of fear. He became despondent.  '

And hence he is not qualified to oppose them in the battle succesfully.'

'Separated from Rama, I do not like to live even for a moment. O tiger among ascetics, it is not proper to take Rama with you.'

' ', 'O sage of great vows, O brahman if at all you intend to take Rama with you, take me  also along with my army.'

'O scion of of Kusika family, sixty thousand years have passed since I was born.  Rama was born to me after a great deal of suffering. It is not proper to take him with you.  '

'My love for Rama among all my four sons is supreme.It is not proper for you to take Rama, the eldest son whose prime qualification  is his virtue.'

'O best of sages, how powerful are those rakshsas? Whose  sons are they? Who are they and how huge is their body? Who are protecting them?'

'O brahman, how to rebuff those deceitful warriors either through Rama or through my army or through me?'

'O venerable one, how to fight those wickednatured ones in the battle and stay aginst them? For rakshasas are proud of their prowess". Having heard the words of Dasaratha, Viswamitra said:'



' ', 'Ravana, king of rakshasas, is the brother of Kubera and son of ascetic Visravana. He is said to possess great prowess.'

'Although endowed with great strength, Ravana, by himself, never created impediments to the sacrifice. But two rakshasas by name Maricha and Subahu are incited by him to cause obstacles".'

' ', 'Informed in this manner by sage Viswamitra, king Dasaratha addressed the sage,  saying, "I am not competent enough to stand before those evilminded rakshasas in the batlle". '

'"You are the knower of righteousness. Extend your favour to my little son and also to me for I am so who is unfortunate. You are verily my spiritual preceptor and god.'

'Gods, danavas, gandharvas, yakshas, birds and great serpents cannot withstand Ravana in battle. What are men to him? (They are no match to him).'

"That rakshasa pulls out warriors' prowess in the battle. O foremost of ascetics Either with forces or with my sons it is not possible for me to engage him or his forces in battle. "

'O brahman although my son resembles the celestials he is not experienced in warfare. On no account shall I spare him.'

'Further the sons of Sunda and Upasunda by name Maricha and Subahu are causing obstacles to your sacrifice. They resemble the god of death, Yama. I shall never part with my son. '

'Maricha and Subahu not only possess prowess but also are experienced in warfare. Together with my group of friends I can combat with one of the two".'

'Having heard the statements of the king the son of Kusika, Viswamitra who was like Indra among the ascetics was seized by great anger.

'O king, if this act of yours is appropriate to you, I will go back (to the places) where from I came. O scion of the race of kakutstha, you have proved false to your promise. Live happily with your relatives".                                                     '

' ', 'At the sight of the wise sage Viswamitra seized of wrath, the entire earth shook and  devatas were gripped in fear.'

'Great Vasishta, an adherent of ascetic practices and steadfast (to duty), seeing that the entire world frightened addressed the king, saying:  '

' ', 'O Dasaratha you are reputed in the three worlds as righteousminded. Do your own ', 'duty. Do not follow an unjust act which is unworthy of respect.'

'O Dasaratha, a promise made and not kept amounts to destruction of merits earned through previous pieties. Therefore send Rama (with him).'

'Trained or not in the use of arms, as long as Rama is protected by Viswamitra, just as nectar is protected by the flaming firegod rakshasas will not be able to compete with him.'

'This (Viswamitra) is an embodiment of righteousness and unsurpassed among the powerful. None can excel him in intellect in this world. He is the supreme refuge in ', 'austerity.'

'Jaya and Suprabha of slender waists are the two daughters of Daksha. They gave  birth to one hundred effulgent sons known as astras and shastras.'

'Formerly Jaya, for the destruction of the army of asuras gave birth to fifty sons by virtue of a boon. They  possess immeasurable power of changing forms at will.'

'Suprabha gave birth to another fifty sons named Samharas who are unassailable,  invincible and more powerful. '

'Viswamitra is well conversant with these weapons. Being virtuous, he is capable of creating new weapons also. '

'Such is the prowess of Viswamitra who is a highly effulgent and highly renowned  sage. O King in sending Rama, you need not entertain any doubt.  '

'Son of Kusika, even though capable of repressing those rakhsasas by himself, it is for the welfare of your son that he is here requesting you to spare him".'

"Satisfied in his mind at the words of the sage (Vasishta), the full one among the Raghus' (Dasaratha) one with wide reputation, his frame shining gave his cheerful ", "consent to the son of Kusika for Rama's departure.", 'इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये बालकाण्डे एकविंशस्सर्ग:।।', 'Thus ends the twentyfirst sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.'

'\nVasishta having said thus, king Dasaratha, with cheerful countenance summoned Rama and Lakshmana.'

"Viswamitra walked in the forefront. Behind him was Rama, bow in hand, while in the archer, Sumitra's son (Lakshmana) with side locks of hair followed."

'Rama and Lakshmana equipped with bows and quivers resembled three hooded serpents. Warriors of no less prowess, they illuminated the ten quarters and followed the high souled Viswamitra like twin Aswanikumaras  following the grandsire, Brahma. '

'Then bows in hand, wellattired, their fingers encased in mongrel skin, for protection (against the bowstring) armed with scimitars, resplendent, young, handsome the two brothers, Rama and Lakshmana shone unblemished. As they followed sage Viswamitra spreading radiance, they looked like sons of the god of fire, (Skanda and Visakhu) following the  incomprehensible Siva.  '

'After crossing a distance of over half a yojana on the southern bank of Sarayu, Viswamitra addressed Rama sweet in a gentle voice.'

'"O child, take this water (in your hands), let there be no delay. You will receive from me a collection of mantras and also bala and atibala. '

' ', '"(If you receive these mantras), you will experience neither fatigue, nor fever nor will there be a change in your appearance. Whether you are asleep or agitated, rakshasas cannot harm you.'

'O Rama, there is none in this world equal to the might of your hands nor does such a person exist in the three worlds.   '

'O sinless one, there is none in this world equal to you in good fortune, kindness, wisdom, in taking a decsion or giving a reply.'

'With these two kinds of knowledge secured, there will be none equal to you, at present or in fututre. Bala and atibala are  mother to all kinds of knowledge .'

'O Rama, best among men, scion in the line of Raghu, on your way you will not feel hunger or thirst if you recite bala and atibala.'

'O Rama, born in the line Kakutstha and one who is righteous, these two radiant sciences are daughters of the grandsire Brahma. If you pursue these two sciences, you will get unequalled fame. You are a fit person to confer these two sciences.'

'\nYou possess all these qualities in great measure. There is no doubt that If these two sciences (mantras) are nourished with austerities they will assume multiple forms (and benefit you)".'

'Thereafter Rama, touched the water and was sanctified. With a cheerful face he received those two sciences from the maharshi who had perceived the supreme soul.  '

'When the night turned into daybreak, the eminent ascetic Viswamitra, addressing the descendants of Kakutstha (Rama and Lakshmana) who were lying on a bed of leaves said:'

'"O beloved son of Kausalya, O Rama the day dawns. O best among men, awake, oblations to gods and other sacred rites are required to be performed". '

' ', 'On hearing the very affectionate call of Viswamitra both the brave princes had their bath and offered oblations to Sungod (standing in the water) and recited the holy name of the Lord.'

'On performing the morning rites, the two highly powerful and and energetic princes stood before Viswamitra who was richly endowed with asceticism. They prostrated before him. And stood ready for their onward journey. '

'Thereafter, having gone a little further both the heroic brothers looked at the confluence of holy  Sarayu with  divine Ganga divided into three branches.'

'There they saw a sacred hermitage of anchorites of great vitality performing severe austerities for thousands of years. '

'Exceedingly delighted to see the sacred hermitage, the two princes enquired from the illustrious sage Viswamitra:'

' ', '"O worshipful one, whose sacred hermitage is this? Who lives here? Indeed, we are curious to know".'

'On having heard their words, the foremost of sages gently smiled and said, "O Rama listen, who this hermitage belonged to in the past".'

'"Kandarpa (the god of love) once lived here in human form. He is called Kama by the learned. The wicked Kama on his way with the maruts (god of wind) insulted Siva, the god of gods, while he was absorbed in austere meditation along with his newly wedded consort. On seeing Kama Lord Siva roared at him (menacingly).'

' ', '"O descendant of Raghu, burnt down by his fierce (third) eye, all the limbs of the body of that evilminded Kama were consumed.'

"Having been completely burnt down by Lord Siva, Kama's body was destroyed. Mighty angry, Siva, reduced Kama to a 'disembodied being."

"O descendant of the Raghus, from that time onwards, he was known as 'Ananga' (one without form). The  beautiful place where he gave up his body is known as Angadesa. "

'This holy hermitage belongs to Kama. These ascetics are his disciples. They are  always righteous and are free from sin.'

' ', 'O auspiciouslooking Rama, we will stay here tonight at the confluence of both these sacred rivers (Sarayu and Ganga) and cross over Ganga tomorrow.'

'O best of men, after morning ablutions offering oblations to the sacred fire, all of us sanctified will enter this pious hermitage".'

' ', 'As they were conversing thus, the ascetics, with their far reaching spiritual vision (beyond the veil of time) recognised them and were immensely pleased.'

'After extending hospitality to the son of Kusika (Viswamitra) with respectful offerings, and water for washing feet they played the host to Rama and Lakshmana. '

'Having received due hospitality, they delighted them (ascetics) with their talk. The rishis with composed minds recited their evening prayer as usual.'

"The ascetics who resided there, faithful to their vows, took them in. There they staed happily  in Kama's hermitage."

'Foremost among the ascetics the son of Kusika (Viswamitra) delighted the charming  princes with enchanting tales.

'Thereafter the destroyers of foes, Rama and Lakshmana offering their morning oblations on that bright dawn arrived at the bank of the river (Ganga) with Viswamitra ahead of them. '

' ', 'All the highminded ascetics and strict followers of vows secured an auspicious boat for them and addressed Viswamitra, saying:'

'With the princes ahead of you, board the boat. Tread the safe path. Let there be no loss of time.'

'"Be it so", said Viswamitra and paid respect to all those sages. And accompanied by them (Rama and Lakshmana), crossed the river flowing towards the sea.'

' ', 'As they reached the midstream, Rama and his younger brother heard a sound greatly  augmented by the speed (of the river).'

'Rama enquired of Viswamitra, the best of sages, "What is this tumultuous sound  bursting out of the waters?"'

' ', 'At the words of Rama filled with curiosity, the righteous (Viswamitra) narrated the true nature of that sound.'

' ', '"O tiger among men, Rama. Brahma created out of his mind a lake on mount Kailas and so that lake is called Manasa (Sarovara).'

"This river which flows from Manasa Sarovara is, therefore, known as 'Sarayu'. It ", 'surrounds  Ayodhya. This sacred river flows from that lake of Brahma.'

'When Ganga approaches this river (Sarayu), there is a clash of waters and this great noise is produced. Rama, offer respectful salutations here, with a calm mind".'

'Deeply religious (in nature) they both made obeisance to the two rivers and reached the southern bank and advanced with quick steps.'

' ', 'He who was a descendent of Ikshvaku and son of the best of kings, (Dasaratha) having seen that untrodden and dreadful forest asked the foremost of the ascetics:'

' ', '"What a wonder This inaccessible forest echoes with the (shrill) chirpings of crickets It is filled with ferocious beasts and birds producing fearful sounds.'

'"It resounds with the frightful shricks of various kinds of birds. Lions, tigers, boars and elephants prowl about.'

' ', 'O Rama, in ancient times after killing Vritrasura, Indra was overpowered by the sin of slaying a brahmin and was affected by impurity and hunger.'

'Devas and rishis endowed with the wealth of asceticism bathed Indra with the (consecrated) waters (brought from all rivers) from the pitchers and got him cleansed of impurities.'

'With the hunger and the taint and impurity from the body of Mahendra removed at this place, the devas rejoiced.'

' ', 'Cleansed of his impurities and his hunger gone, Indra once again became pure. Allpowerful Indra highly pleased gave an excellent boon to that region.'

"Having seen the honour bestowed on that land by the wise Indra, the gods said to him, 'Well done, Well done'. "

'O Destroyers of enemies these prosperous townships, Malada and Karusha looked cheerful with (bumper) crops and wealth for a long time. '

'Then, after a lapse of several years, O gentle one a terrible yakshini by name Tataka,  ', 'wife of intelligent Sunda, capable of assuming different forms at will, possessed of the strength of a thousand elephants and mother of a rakshasa known as Maricha armed with the power of Indra took possession of this place.'

'The arms (of Maricha) are round and strong. He is highly energetic. He has a large face and a huge body. In appearance, he is gigantic and possesses a dreadful form. That rakshasa always threatened the inhabitants.'

'Rama having killed the daughter of yaksha was praised by multitudes of devatas and siddhas. He stayed in the same forest with the sage. At the first glimpse of dawn, he was awakened by the sage (Viswamitra).', 'इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये बालकाण्डे षड्विंशस्सर्ग:।।7', 'Thus ends the twentysixth sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.'

'The night over, illustrious Viswamitra called Rama with a sweet smile.'

' ', '"O prince of great renown, I am extremely pleased. May you prosper Out of great love and affection for you I shall make over all the weapons.'

'With the help of these celestial weapons, you will vanquish even gods and demons, serpents together with gandharvas if they challenge you to a battle as enemies and take them as captives. I shall confer on you all such weapons. May you prosper'

'Mighty armed, heroic Rama I shall grant you the great celestial dandachakra. O best among men I shall grant you dharmachakra, kalachakra, visnuchakra, indraastra, vajraastra and the great, trident of Siva, brahmashirastra, ishika astra and highly superior brahmaastra. '

'Born in the race of kakutstha and a tiger among men, O Rama I shall also grant two  shining maces known as modaki and shikhari.'

'Rama, I shall grant dharmapasa, kalapasa, varuna pasa, too unique weapons.'

'O descendant of Raghu I shall grant you two thunderbolts named shuska and ardra (dry and wet), painaka astra and narayanaastra.  '

'O blemishless Rama I shall grant you agneyaastra known as sikhara which is my ', 'favour weapon and vayavyaastra  known as prathana৷৷'

'O Rama bron in the Kakutstha race, I shall grant you two powers named hayasira (Horse head) and kraunchaastra.'

'I shall grant all these weapons, the dreadful kankala, pestle kapala and kankana used by asuras.'

'\nO mightyarmed prince, I shall grant mahaastra, vaidyadhara and an excellent scimitar known as nandana.'

'Rama, I shall grant two much favoured weapons namely gandharvaastras, manava  astra, which induce and suppress sleep and sauraastra as well.  '

'O renowned prince, best among men, receive these astras known as darpana, soshana, santhapana, vilapana, madana astra, the unassailable one favoured by kamadeva  and the paisacha astra known as mohana favoured by demons.'

"O tiger among men mighty prince, accept tamasa and saumanaastras, the unassailable, samavardha weapon, mausala, satyaastra, the supreme mayadhara astra, the terrible tejaprabhaastra capable of removing the energy of the opponent, a soft weapon called sisira, supremely formidable twashtus astra, Bhaga's terrible shiteshuastra (sharp arrowed one) and manava astra."

'O Rama mightyarmed prince, receive these mighty and highly exalted  astras capable of assuming at once any form at will". '

'Viswamitra, the greatest ascetic after the purification ritual stood with his face turned  east and happily, conferred on Rama collection of the unique mantras.'

' ', 'The sage offered Rama the complete collection of those weapons which even the celestials find it difficult to acquire.'

' ', 'While the sagacious ascetic Viswamitra was muttering the mystic terms of these venerable astras (addressing their respective deities), all these weapons (with their mystic power) attended on Rama.'

'The munificient presiding deities of the weapons with folded palms addressed these words to Rama saying, "Here we are, at you disposal ".'

'Rama received the astras he felt with his hands and commanded them saying, "Live in my mind" (serve me whenever I remember you).'

' ', 'Thereafter, the cheerful Rama, bowed to the mighty ascetic Viswamitra and commenced his journey.', 'इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये बालकाण्डे सप्तविंशस्सर्गः।।', 'Thus ends the twentyseventh sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.'

' ', 'After performing the purificatory rites, Rama received the weapons with a cheerful face. In the way Rama said to Viswamitra.'

' ', '"O venerable one, having received these weaponsI have become unassailable even by the celestials. O best of ascetics, May I know the way to withdraw these weapons".'

'To these words spoken by Rama, maharshi Viswamitra who was patient practitioner of vows and pure taught the withdrawl mantra.'

'"O Rama the descendant of Raghu, receive from me the effulgent weapons who are the sons of Bhrusasva and who are capable of changing forms at will. They are  Satyavanta, Satyakirti, Dhrishta, Rabhasa, Pratiharatara, Paranmukha (turned back wards), Avanmukha (turned downwards), Lakshaksha, Vishama, Drudhanabha and Sunabha, Dasaksha, Satavaktra, Dasasheersha and Satodara, Padamanabha and Mahanabha, Dundunabha and Sunabhaka, Jyotisha, Krusanam, both Nairasya and  Vimala, Yogandhara, Haridradaitya, Prasamana, Sarchirmali, Dhri, Mali, Vrtiimanta, also Ruchira, Pitrusaumanasa, bothVidhuta Makara, Karaveera Kara, Dhana, Dhanya, Kama Roopa, Kamaruchi, Moha, also Avarana, Jrumbhaka, Sarvanabha, also Santhana and Varuna. You are worthy of receiving these weapons. May you prosper.  '

'\n"Certainly" said Rama, and with a delighted heart received the astras. Some of the astra devatas were coal-black, some like smoke, some resembled rays of Sun or Moon. Assuming corporal forms, with shining, divine bodies, those weapons the their bodies bent down and palms folder they spoke to Rama in a gentle voice: "O tiger among men, here we are, What can we do for you"?'

'Rama spoke to them (astra devatas) saying, "Reside in my mind and render assistance  in times of need. Now you can go according to your will".'

'Thereafter those devatas having said, "Be it so", circumambulated Rama, took leave of him and returned to their respective abodes from where they had come.'

'After having acquired the knowledge of the weapons Rama addressed maharshi Viswamitra in gentle and soft words while walking along with him.'

' ', '"From this side of the mountain, not  faroff from here stand shining and goodlooking trees resembling clouds. It is replete scattered with animals, pleasing to the mind and extremely beautiful. It is adorned with various kinds of birds singing sweetly. What could be this? I am very curious to know.'

'O best of acetics, I think we have come out of that  awesome (horripilating) forest because of the pleasant feeling experienced in this region. Whose hermitage is this? O Revered one tell me".'

'O great ascetic, O venerable brahmana, from where do those slayers of brahmanas, doers of cruel acts, wickedminded and sinful persons come from and cause obstacles to your sacrifice? Where is that sacrificial place required to be protected by me? Where are these rakshasas required to be slain? O best of ascetics, I would like to hear from you".

"The highly lustrous Viswamitra heard the words of Rama of immeasurable prowess. On his (Rama's) query about the forest, Viswamitra explains."

' ', '"O mightyarmed Rama Lord Visnu, the foremost among the gods, and master the great ascetic lived here carrying out yogic practices and penance for innumerable years  constituting hundreds of yugas.'

'"O Rama this was the hermitage of glorious Vamana. The great sage her performed his ascetic pratices here, hence it is known as siddhashrama.'

' ', '"During the period Visnu (in the incarnation of Vamana) was observing austerities at this hermitage, king Bali, son of Virochana, having vanquished Indra and maruts and devatas ruled this kingdom and became famous in all the three worlds (for his prowess and generosity.)'

'"While Bali was performing the sacrifice (to confirm his position as lord of the three worlds), the devas got together with Agni in the forefront and approached Lord Visnu ', 'at this hermitage, saying:'

' ', "'O Visnu son of Virochana is performing a great sacrifice. Before its completion, our purpose ought to be achieved'."

"'He is granting the seekers whatever, wherever and in whichever maner they, coming from here and there approach him for favour'."

' ', '"O Visnu perform this supreme, auspicious act assuming the form of a dwarf through, the power of illusion for the welfare of the devatas\'.  '

' ', '"O Rama in the mean time revered Kasyapa resplendent like the god of fire radiating lustre with Aditi who had completed a thousand divine years of austerities pleased (with her penance) the conferer of boons, Lord Madhusudana" (Visnu) (And she said to Visnu):'

'"You are all ascetism, a mass of tapas, and an embodiment of tapas. Your soul is tapas. O Purushottama I am beholding you after a rigorous penance.'

' ', '"O Lord I am beholding this entire universe in your body. You are beginningless and  indescribable. I take refuge in you".'

'Addressing Kasyapa whose sins had been washed clean, Lord Visnu pleased (with his penance) said: "Be prosperous you are dear to me. Worthy of a boon. Ask."'

'Having heard those words of Vishnu, Kasyapa, son of Maricha, replied, "O bestower of boons, O great practitioner of austerities Be pleased to grant a boon for Aditi, devatas and for myself.'

'"O Sinless Lord, Be born son to Aditi and to me, O Destroyer of asuras, be the younger brother to Indra. You can help these sorrowstricken devatas.'

' ', 'O Lord of the celestials, with my penance accomplished (here) this place will be known as siddhaashrama by your grace. O Lord arise from here".'

'Then the resplendent Visnu, born from the womb of Aditi and assuming the form of Vamana, approached, the son of Virochana (Bali).'

'Thereafter, Visnu, soul of the universe who restores respect (for the righeous), and renders the welfare of all living beings, having begged from Bali, and been granted three places to put his footsteps on occupied the (three) worlds and by restraining Bali with his energy, gave (it) back to Mahendra. In this manner the highly lustrous Visnu, gave  possession of the three worlds to Mahendra.'

' ', '"This asrama, which relieves fatigue, previously under the possession of Vamana, has come under my occoupation for my devotion to him.'

' ', '"O tiger among men, wicked rakshasas who prowl about the asram and cause ', 'obstacles ought to be killed here only.'

' ', '"O Rama, now let\'s go to the unparalleled Siddhashrama. O child this asrama is the same to you as it is to me (treat this as your own)".'

'While enetering the hermitage the great ascetic appeared resplendent (in the company of Rama and Lakshmana) like the moon in conjunction with Punarvasu star emerging out of  the mist.'

'At the sight of Viswamitra all the ascetics, inmates of Siddhashrama, jumped out instantly and offered him their worship.'

'They extended hospitality to both the princes in the same way they offered their worship to the sagacious Viswamitra.'

'The two princes of the lineage of Raghu, destroyers of foes rested a while and then said to Viswamitra, a tiger amon sages:'

'O foremost of ascetics Get initialed today. You will prosper and this asram will attain its fulfilment. Your words shall come true.'

'Saying this, Viswamitra, the great saint effulgent and self trained engaged himself in the  initiation ceremony.'

'The two princes spent the right comfortably and woke up at daybreak. They  performed morning in accordance with the prescribed rule, ablutions, said their prayers and paid their respects to Viswamitra seated at the kindled firesacrifice.', 'इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये बालकाण्डे एकोनत्रिंशस्सर्ग:।।', 'Thus ends the twentyninth sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.'

'Thus spoke the two princes to Viswamitra. They were conscious of place and time to speak and capable of conquering enemies. '

'"O adorable Brahmarshi, we want to know around what time the rakshasas will make their appearance so that the sacrifice can be protected. Let  not that moment pass".'

'The sages (of the asrama) were very pleased. They extolled the princes of Kakustha dynasty, who were eager to fight the rakshasas.'

'"O sons of Raghu\'s lineage protect the sacrifice for six nights from today. With the ceremoney initiated, the sage would  observe silence said the inmates".'

'At these words of the sages the illustrious princes got ready to protect the tapovana for six days and six nights without sleep. '

'The two mighty, heroic archers (Rama and Lakshmana), destroyers of enemies ', 'attended upon the sacrifice in order to protect sage Viswamitra. '

' ', 'Time passed. When the sixth day arrived Rama cautioned Lakshmana to be vigilant.'

'While he was fracing up for a fight, the fire on the sacrificial altar with the officiating priests and spiritual guides suddenly brightened.'

' ', 'The altar with Viswamitra and the officiating priests, kusa grass, ladles and square ', 'vessels, bundles of sticks and  flowers, (used in the sacrificfial fire) got brightened up.'

'While the sacrifice was being performed in accordance with mantras, a great sound causing fear emerged from the sky. '

' ', 'Like the clouds in the rainy season, the two rakshasas (Maricha and Subahu), covering the sky through their power of illusion, came running (to the sacrificial place). '

'Maricha and Subahu of fearful appearance arrived with their followers and rained streams of blood (on the sacrificial altar).'

'Flames rose on the sacrificial altar drenched by the stream of blood. Immediately Rama rushed forward and beheld them in the sky.'

'Having seen them (Maricha and Subahu) suddenly advancing the lotuseyed Rama gazed at Lakshmana and said:'

'"O Lakshmana, behold, by manavaastra I shall chase, like clouds scattered by winds those wicked rakshasas who eat human flesh".'

'The inflamed Rama hurled the highly powerful and effulgent Manavaastra on the chest of Maricha.'

'Smitten by that powerful Manavaastra, Maricha was thrown to a full distance of hundred yojanas into the surging high seas. '

'Having seen Maricha beaten by the power of that coolarrowed astra, thrown to a distance, reeling and lying unconscious, Rama spoke to Lakshmana: '

'"O Lakshmana behold this Manavaastra associated with righteousness employing a cool arrow, which carries him away by making him unconscious and yet not taking his life.'

'\n"I shall slay these merciless, wicked, doers of sinful acts, destroyers of sacrifices and blood-thirsty ', 'rakshasas', '".'

'Then Rama took hold of the celestial, marvellous Agneya weapon and hurled it into the chest of Subahu. Struck, Subahuhe fell down on the ground. '

'Illustrious and highly generous Rama killed the  remaining rakshasas  with the Vayavya weapon to the delight of the ascetics.'

'Having killed the rakshasas, obstructors of sacrifices, Rama was worshipped by the hermits like Indra was honoured in the past when he was victorious.'

'Thereafter, when the sacrifice was completed, maharshi Viswamitra beholding all the directions  bereft of evils, said to Rama:'

'There, with their purpose fulfilled the heroes, Rama and Lakshmana, full of joy in their hearts spent the night.'

' ', 'As the night dawned, both the brothers performed the morning rites and approached Viswamitra and other rishis.'

'Sweettongued, they visited with folded hands the best of ascetics Viswamitra who was shining like a flaming fire and addressed him  thus in sweet and generous words:'

' ', '"O tiger among ascetics, we  two are at your  service. Command whatever you want and we shall execute" it.'

' ', 'Addressed, thus by both of them, Viswamitra ahead of all the sages, spoke to Rama.'

' ', '"O foremost of men, Janaka, king of Mithila, is performing a great religious sacrifice. We shall go there. '

' ', 'O tiger among men, come along with us. You ought to see there the wonderful  jewel of a bow.'

'O best among men, this bow of immeasurable energy. dreadful and highly lustrous was bestowed on king Janaka by devatas in a sacrificial  assembly in the past.'

'Neither devas, nor gandharvas, nor asuras nor human, are capable of stringing the bow by any means.'

' ', 'Mighty princes and kings have failed to string it, in their attempt to know its strength.'

'O best of men, O descendent of Kakustha, there you will see the bow that belongs to the magnanimous king of Mithila and the wonderful sacrifice at that place.'

' ', 'O best among men, that excellent bow strong in the middle was offered by king of Mithila, Devarata as well as by all devatas as fruit of the sacrifice.    '

'O Rama, that bow is worshipped in the king\'s palace as principal deity with various kinds of perfumes, sandal paste, incense and fragrant agaru".  '

'Having spoken thus, Viswamitra,  the best of ascetics commenced the onward journey along with the Kakutshas and rishis, taking leave of the deities of the forest.     '

'"(O ascetics of the forest) May you be safe. My purpose has been achieved in this Siddhaashrama. From here I shall go to the Himavanta mountain situated on the ', 'northern bank of  Jahnavi" (said Viswamitra).'

'Thereafter, circumambulating the supreme Siddhasrama with reverence, they (Viswamitra and the princes) commenced their journey in the northern direction.  '

'As Viswamitra, the best of ascetics set out on his journey, expounders of the Vedas followed him, nearly in one hundred carriages.'

'Birds and beasts living in Siddhaashrama also followed the illustrious maharshi ', 'Viswamitra over a long distance until he sent them back.'

'The sages travelled a long distance and halted on the bank of  Sona at sunset. '

'The sages who possessed great splendour bathed and offered oblations to fire at sunset and sat in front of  Viswamitra. '

'Rama together with Lakshmana having offered respectful salutations to the sages, sat in front of the sagacious Viswamitra.'

'Thereafter highly lustrous Rama, the best among men, filled with curiosity enquired of ', 'the great sage Viswamitra:'

'"O worshipful one, what could be the reason for this region shining with luxuriant groves?  I wish to hear from you. You can tell me all about this (region). May it be safe for you"  '

' ', 'A sage of  excellent vows and rigid austerities, Viswamitra, urged by the words of Rama, described  in the midst of rishis the entire story relating to that region.', 'इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये बालकाण्डे एकत्रिंशस्सर्ग:।।', 'Thus ends the thirtyfirst sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.'

'There was a great ascetic named Kusa, born to Brahma, as ascetic indefatigable in vows, knowldegeable in dharma and a respector of the virtuous.'

' ', 'That great soul, Kusa, married the princess of Vidarbha  born in a noble family and a match for him. He begot four virtuous sons who resembled him. They were Kusamba, Kusanabha, Adhurtarajas and Vasu.'

'Kusa addressed his four brilliant sons who were highly enthusiastic, pious, truthful and were wedded to duties of the warrior race:'

' ', '"O my sons, govern with righteousness so that you will acquire immense merit\'. Hearing the words of the rishi, the four sons who were the best among men and revered in the world constructed four cities as their abodes.'

' ', 'The brilliant Kushamba and the righteous Kushanabha constructed the cities of ', 'Kaushanbi and Mahodaya (as their capital) respectively.'

'O Rama king Adhurtarajasa constructed Dharmaranya, the best of cities and king Vasu, the city of Girivrajam.'

'O Rama this place where we are (called Vasumati) belongs to the magnanimous king Vasu. This is  surrounded by five great shining mountains.  '

'The delightful and renowned river Sumagadhi (known as Sona), flowing in the country of Magadha, looks beautiful like a garland amidst five great mountains.'

' ', 'Rama, this Magadhi river, of great Vasu flows from the east surrounded by fertile crops fields like a garland. '

'O scion of the Raghu family, the virtuous rajarshi Kusanabha begot one hundred beautiful daughters through a nymph named Ghritachi.'

' ', 'Those welladorned, beautiful, young maidens in the pleasuregarden looked like lightnings in the rainy season. Bedecked with fine ornaments they were singing, dancing, playing on instruments and moving in all directions in great delight.'

'With beautiful limbs of unparalleled beauty on earth, they shone in the pleasuregarden like stars in the midst of clouds.'

' ', 'At the sight of the maidens embellished with all virtues and youth and beauty, the allpervading Windgod addressed them these words:'

'I request you all to be my wives. You will leave this feeling of mortality and attain a ', 'long life.'

' ', 'Youth is always unstable, especially in human beings. If you marry me, you will be ever youthful like devatas. '

'At the works of the untiringly blowing Windgod the lunged maidens laughed and said:'

'"O best among devatas you move within all living beings, we feel your impact. Why do you insult us?'

' ', '"O best among devatas we are daughters of Kusanabha, We are capable of pulling you down from your position. We are safeguarding our ascetic merit as virgins (we could curse you to save our ascetic merit)" of Kusnabha. '

' ', 'O wicked one, do not dishonour our father who always speaks the truth. He will choose the bridegrooms righteously. Do not invite death (father may be the cause of your death).'

'Our father is our lord. Our father is god to us. Whomsoever our father offers us shall become our husband".'

'Having heard the words of those maidens, the most powerful and venerable Windgod became furious. He entered all the limbs of their bodies, twisted and distorted them.'

'Their bodies disfigured and shattered by the Windgod, the maidens with tears flowing from their eyes entered the palace and fell down on the ground, agitated and overtaken by shame.'

'The king saw his extremely beautiful beloved daughters distressed and shattered and spoke these words with bewilderment.'

'On hearing the words of sagacious Kusanabha, his hundred daughters touched his feet  with their heads and  said:'

'"O king, the  allpervading Windgod, having taken recourse to foul means intended to outrage our modesty without and moral compunction.'

'The deeply religious and highly powerful king, having heard those words of his one hundred exceptional daughters, replied: '

'"O daughters you have done a great act of forgiveness of which only the tolerant are capable. By taking a united stand, you have protected the honour of my dynasty.'

'Whether for women or men forgiveness is an ornament. It is difficult even for gods. For you, daughters, to show it without any difference of opinion is especially hard.'

' ', '"Forbearance is charity, forbearance is sacrifice, forbearance is truth, forbearance is glory and forbearance is virtue. O daughters, the universe is supported by forbearance".  '

'"O Rama after sending away his daughters, the king endowed with the power of the celestials and wellversed in the art of counselling, consulted his ministers about a suitable person for marriage of his daughters at proper time and place.'

"When her services came to a fruition with the passage of time, maharshi Chuli, spoke to her: 'I am pleased with you. What favour shall I do for you? May you be prosperous'"

'Having perceived that the sage was satisfied, the gandharva who was skilled in speech said exceedingly delighted to the sage in a sweet voice.'

'Bestowed with the great asceticism and brilliance of a brahmin, you look like Brahma. O righteous one, I desire a son endowed with the ascetic virtues of a brahmin.'

' ', 'I am without a husband, my sire. I am not a wife to any one. Since I have taken refuge in you, you are competent to bestow on me a son with the power of your penance".'

'Conferring the benefit of the other world and worldly pleasures on men my sister  Kausiki who is divine and beautiful having sacred waters took resort in Himavat mountain and started flowing from there. '

' ', 'Ganga, famous and foremost of rivers, destroyer of all sins, flowed in the direction  king Bhagiratha moved.'

'Then while Ganga was flowing, it inundated the sacrificial ground of the great sage Jahnu. Jahnu who used to work wonders was performing a sacrifice.  '

'O Descendant of the Raghu dynasty sage Jahnu who was performing the sacrifice, observed her pride and grew  furious. And astonishingly drank the entire waters of Ganga.'

'Devatas, rishis and gandharvas stood amazed (at this act). They worshipped the magnanimous Jahnu, noblest among men. The devatas entreated the illustrious Jahnu to treat Ganga as his daughter.'

'The brilliant (Jahnu) was pleased. He released her through both his both ears. Hence Ganga is called Jahnavi, daughter of Jahnu. '

'Ganga, best among rivers, following the chariot of Bhagiratha, reached the ocean. She entered the nether regions of the earth in order to fulfil his mission (salvation of the sons of Sagara).'

'Rajarshi Bhagiratha, having brought Ganga with supreme efforts, saw with a sad heart his grandfathers reduced to ashes.'

'Thereupon that king followed by Ganga reached the ocean and entered the lower regions of the earth where the sons of Sagara were found reduced to ashes.'

'After the ashes were inundated by the waters of Ganga, Brahma, lord of the world,   appeared before king Bhagiratha and said:'

'"O Tiger among men sixty thousand sons of illustrious Sagara having been liberated, had gone towards heaven like devatas.'

'O King as long as the waters in the ocean exist in this world, shall the sons of Sagara, live in heavens like gods.'

'This Ganga will become your eldest daughter and from now on she will be wellknown in this world (as Bhagirathi) after your name.'

' ', 'O King divine Ganga will be called Tripathaga as well as Bhagirathi. Since she flows in the three worlds (heaven, earth and the lower world: Patala), she will be known as ', 'Tripathaga.'

'O Lord of men O King you may offer the waters of  Ganga here to all your ancestors and thereby fulfil your vow.'

'O King by the highly renowned ancestors of yours, the foremost among righteous ones (even Sagara) this desire has not been fulfilled.  '

'O Child similarly though Anshuman possessed unparalleled prowess in this world his prayer to Ganga, his vow could not be fulfilled.'

'O Sinless one (Bhagiratha) O Distinguished one on the part of Dilipa brilliant your father who had the virtuous of a rajarshi, who was equal to a maharshi in splendour, and to me in austerities and abiding to the duties of a kshatriya it was even not possible to bring Ganga through prayer.'

'O Best among men you have fulfilled that vow. You have achieved supreme renown ', 'and reverence in this world. '

'\n"The Grandsire of all the worlds, highly renowned lord of the gods, having Said this, returned to heaven the way he had come.'

'The illustrious rajarshi Bhagiratha, performed the rites of offering the sacred water of Ganga, in accordance with proper order and tradition for the sons of Sagara. Purified with the ablutions entered his own city." O Best of the Raghus his desire thus fulfilled he continued to rule the kingdom thereafter". '

'"O Best of the Raghus the world rejoiced having Bhagiratha as king. With his purpose achieved, he was freed from all mental afflictions and sorrows and thereafter lived happily.'

'O Rama I have related you the story of Ganga in detail. Evening time is passing by (and we shall perform the ablutions) farewell.'

'He will be blessed with fame, longevity, progeny and (after death) heaven brahmins One who recites this story of Ganga to the kshatriyas and others, the gods and his forefathers would be pleased with him.'

'Then Rama along with Lakshmana spent the whole night reflecting on the auspicious story narrated by Viswamitra.'

'Thereafter, the progeny of the Raghus, the destroyer of enemies (Rama) addressed Viswamitra in the clear early morning after Viswamitra had completed his routine rites:'

' ', '"O Noble ascetic we have heard this great story worthy to be listened. As we both lay pondering over the entire story (narrated by you), the glorious night passed off just like a moment.'

'We will cross over Ganga, the best of rivers, the sacred river that flows in three directions.This boat of pious saints which is well laidout has come here swiftly, having come to know that you, O Venerable one have arrived".'

'Hearing the words of noble Rama, he (Viswamitra), accompanied by hosts of sages besides Rama and Lakshmana made arrangements to cross (the river).'

'Having reached the northern bank, they paid homage to the sages encamped on the bank of  Ganga and beheld the city of Vishala.  '

'Thereupon Viswamitra, the best of ascetics, accompanied by Rama and Lakshmana soon proceeded towards the enchanting and splendid city of Vishala comparable to heaven.'

'Thereafter great intellectual, Rama, with folded palms enquired of eminent ascetic Viswamitra, about the excellent city of Vishala. '

'"O Distinguished ascetic, which royal dynasty is ruling this city of Vishala? Could you tell me? Great is my curiosity. May you prosper"'

'Viswamitra, preeminent among ascetics, hearing the words of Rama commenced to relate the history of the ancient city of Vishala.'

'"O Rama hear the auspicious legend of Indra. Listen, too, what had happened to this ', 'country. '

'O Blessed Rama in kritayuga, the sons of Diti were very strong and those of Aditi were spirited and righteous.'

"O Best among men a thought came to those illustrious ones, 'how can we be  free from old age, death and disease'? "

'"O Rama While the noble sons were reflecting over this matter an idea flashed across their minds to get nectar by churning the ocean of milk.'

'Thereupon, having decided to churn (the ocean mind) those very powerful ones, made Vasuki, (the great snake), as a rope and Mandara mountain as the churning rod.And started churning it.'

'After a thousand years, the hoods of the snake made as rope vomitted venom and started biting the rocks of the Mandara mountain with their teeth. '

'Therefrom was produced halahala, virulent venom resembling fire.The entire universe  consisting of devatas, asuras and mortals was burnt down.'

"The devatas sought refuge in the great god Rudra who causes happiness, the Lord of all living beings. 'Save us, Save us', the cried."

' ', 'Thereupon, Hari the Lord of celestial beings extolled by the devatas appeared bearing the conch and discus.'

'Hari, smiling said to the tridentbearing Rudra "O Chief of celestial beings you were born the earliest among the devatas. Therefore, while churning the ocean whichever is produced first shall be offered to you. Considering it the first offering, O Lord accept this venom."'

"Visnu, the highest among the devatas having the spoken, vanished. Siva who had heard Visnu's words and seen the fear of the gods received that  dreadful halahala  ", 'treating it as nectar.'

'Lord of the gods, venerable Siva went away to his abode leaving behind the devatas. O Descendant of Raghu then all the devatas and asuras resumed churning.'

"'O Sinless one after the mountain (Mandara) used as churning rod sank down to nether world (patala) the devatas along with the gandharvas invoked Visnu'."

'"O mightyarmed Visnu you are the ultimate refuge for all living beings, specially for the devatas. Protect us, you (alone) are fit to lift up the Mandara mountain". '

'Having heard these words, the controller of the sense organs, Visnu, assumed the form of a tortoise reclined in the ocean supporting the mountain on its back.'

' ', 'Visnu, the Supreme being, the soul of the universe standing amidst the devatas took hold of the peak of mountain with his hand and continued to churn the ocean.'

'In this way thousand years rolled by. In the beginining came out Dhanvantari holding a staff and a water pot (carried by ascetics) and apsaras of high lustre. '

'O Best among men excellent women emerged out of the essence produced by churning of waters. Therefore they are known as apsarasas. '

'\n"O Rama! afflicted with great grief when her sons were killed, Diti said to her husband Kasyapa, son of Maricha:'

'"O adorable one, your highly powerful sons, (devatas) have killed mine through extensive austerities. I am desirous of obtaining a (mighty) son capable of killing Indra. '

'I shall practise austerities. You ought to grant me a son who would be the supreme ruler of the world and capable of killing Indra. You can say yes (if you will)".'

"Then, Maricha's son, exceedingly bright Kasyapa on hearing the words of Diti who was deeply grieved replied:"

'"O one vested with the wealth of austerities be it so. Prosperity to you Remain chaste, you will deliver a son who will kill Indra in the battle.'

'"If you remain pure and clean, on completion of a thousand years you will give birth to a son through me who will be the lord of the three worlds".'

'Highly brilliant Kasyapa, having thus spoken, touched her gently with his palm, stroked her body and said, "May good betide thee". Having said this, Kasyapa went away to perform austerities.'

'"O foremost among men after Kasyapa had left, Diti exceedingly delighted (at the prospect of having sons) reached Kushaplavana, and practised intense mortifications.'

'O foremost of men great treasure of virtues while she was practising austerities, the thousandeyed Indra  began to serve her.'

'The thousandeyed Indra served her by providing fire, Kusha grass, sticks for burning, ', 'water, fruits, roots and all other things desired by her.'

'"O best of the gods your illustrious father granted me a boon for a son I sought on completion of a thousand years (of penance). '

'O the best of the brave ten years is yet to go (for completion of austerities). You will  have a brother. May you prosper'

'O Child I\'ll create in him eagerness victory. Together with him you will gain victory over the three worlds. Relieved of sorrows, enjoy you\'ll with him".'

'After speaking thus to Indra, goddess Diti overpowered with sleep around midsday dropped off, her feet towards her head.'

'Indra laughed. He rejoiced at the sight of her ominous posture of sleeping with her feet towards her head and her hair falling on her feet.'

'O Rama that embryo, being severed by Vajra having a hundred edges, cried at high pitch which awakened Diti".'

'Highly powerful Indra, even while saying to the crying embryo  "Do not weep, Do not weep" severed it.'

'"O Indra, Slayer of Balasura, because of my fault this embryo has been made into ', 'seven pieces and rendered useless. In this matter you have not committed any fault.  '

'This disaster to the embryo has happened contrary to expectations. Hence, I seek a favour from you. Let these seven pieces become seven guardians of marut regions (regions of the wind). '

'Among them, one will move about in Brahmaloka, another in Indraloka, and the third, well known as vayu will move around in the sky.'

'O best of devatas by your command the other four sons will remain celestial, and will range about in four directions.'

'"Everything will, no doubt, happen the way you said. Your sons will wander about as celestial beings. Prosperity to you."'

'"O Rama mother and sons having arrived at this conclusion in the tapovana  ascended to heaven with their desire fulfilled. This is what we have heard."'

'"O Sage, wish you well Who are these two youths who seem to possess the  prowess of celestial beings. They walk with the gait of an elephant or a lion. They are courageous like tiger or a bull. Their large eyes are like lotuspetals. They are armed with scimitars, bows and quivers. They are young and handsome like Aswinikumaras dropped from heaven casually. Whose sons are they? How did they  come here on foot? With what purpose?'

'O Great ascetic they resemble each other in personality, expression and gestures. They adorn this land like Sun and moon in the sky holding excellent weapons. These heroes have trodden paths difficult to traverse. For what purpose have they come? I want to hear clearly".'

'Subsequently, Indra beheld the great ascetic Gautama, unassailable by devatas and danavas, endowed with the power of ascetism, drenched with sacrifical waters,  shining like flaming fire, carrying sacrificial firewood and Kusha grass and preeminent  among sages, entering that leaf hut.'

'On seeing him, the face of the Lord of the gods (Indra) turned pale with fear. Having seen the wicked Indra with a thousandeyed in the guise of an ascetic the gentle sage Gautama got enraged and said:'

'In response to the words of Viswamitra Rama and Lakshmana entered the  hermitage, Viswamitra in front.'

'Rama beheld the highly fortunate Ahalya, shining brilliantly with the power of her asceticism. She could not be seen even by men, suras or asuras joined together. She looked  divine and illusory as if created with special efforts by Brahma. Though not clearly visible, she was shining bright like the light of the full Moon muffled by mists in the sky and like the inviolable light of the Sun reflected in the water. '

'O Illustrious sage thousands of brahmins living in different countries and versed in  the study of the vedas have assembled here. The shelters for ascetics are thronged with hundreds of carts. O Great ascetic let us choose a place where we can stay.  '

It was inhabited by brahmarshis and devarishis, by sages who had attained perfection through austerities, by those resembling fire in brightness, by the magnanimous and the selfrestrained, by those who had conquered anger and controlled their senses, who was devoted to prayers and offerings of libations.

'O Tormentor of enemies O Sinless one O Tiger among men is it all well with your army, treasury, friends, sons and grandsons?'

'Highly brilliant king Viswamitra, humbly informed Vasishta that all was well.'

'Both the righteous personalities dwelt at length on various matters and interesting anecdotes with great delight and derived mutual pleasure. '

'O Descendent of Raghu at the end of the conversation, venerable Vasishta, smiling as ', 'it were said to Viswamitra'

'O Highy powerful Viswamitra I wish to offer appropriate hospitality to you and to your incomparable army. Be pleased to accept it.'

' ', 'Please accept the honour I extend. Being a king, you are a distinguished guest. you deserve to be treated respectfully in all possible ways".'

'To these words of Vasishta, the great intellectual Viswamitra said, "you have spoken pleasing words. This in itself is hospitality for me".'

'"O Worshipful one O Profoundly wise one you are worthy of homage. You have excellently honoured me in all possible ways with whatever fruits and roots available in your hermitage, with water for washing feet and for sipping. You have permitted me darshan with your revered self. I shall leave (now). My regards Look upon me with eyes of friendship".'

'As the king was addressing thus the righteous and generous Vasishta, repeatedly requested him to accept his hospitality.'

'The son of Gadhi said to Vasishta, "O Preeminent among sages, be it so, O venerable one they will be done".'

' ', 'Vasishta who was highly brilliant the greatest among those who meditate (on Brahman) and free from sins was pleased. Thereafter he called the speckled cow (Kamadhenu): '

'"O Sabala, come on quick Listen to my words. I have decided to honour this royal saint and his army with excellent food. Make necessary arrangemets.'

'O Kamadhenu quickly entertain them for my sake with the food of six kinds of tastes (varieties of rich dishes) as desired by each. '

'O Sabala create at once all food items consisting of liquids and solids for drinking, tasting and siping."', 'इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये बालकाण्डे द्विपञ्चाशस्सर्ग:।', 'Thus ends the fiftysecond sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.'

'"O Destroyer of foes (Rama)" addressed thus by Vasishta the wishfulfilling Sabala satisfied each one\'s  desires.'

'Sugarcane, honey and fried grain, invigorating liquors in good containers, excellent drinks and varieties of food (were served).'

'Heaps of hot rice as high as mountains, savoury food, condiments and on abundance of curd, various kinds of soups, containers in their thousands completely filled with edibles with all six tastes and preparations made of jaggery (were distributed).'

' ', '"O Rama, Vasistha entertained everybody in Viswamitra\'s army to their full satisfaction. They were all wellfed and happy.'

'King Viswamitra along with ladies, priests and brahmins including the royal sage were fully satisfied and delighted.'

'Having received the hospitality along with his counsellors, ministers and attendants, Viswamitra, filled with great delight, said to Vasishta":'

'"O Brahman you are worthy of worship. I was received with reverence and wellentertained by you. O Sage conversant with speech listen.'

' ', '"I shall give you a hundred thousand cows in exchange for Sabala. O Respectable one this cow is a gem. A king (along) has a right on jewels, O Brahmin, for that reason, Sabala rightfully belongs to me. Therefore, give this cow".'

'Addressed the by Viswamitra venerable and righteous Vasishta who was of the earth  ascetic replied:  '

'"O King I shall not exchange Sabala for a hundred thousand for even or a hundred crore cows or heaps of silver.'

'O Suppressor of enemies Viswamitra it is not proper to separate this cow from me. The relationship between Sabala and me is permanent like the relationship between a  righteous man and his fame.'

'For havyam (oblations to gods) and kavyam (oblations to ancestors), for fulfilling the necessities of life, maintenance of the sacred fire and offering oblations to all spirits of created beings, and for offerings made to the Firegod I depend on this cow.'

'O Royal saint swaha and vashat and various branches of learning are all dependent on this cow. No doubt about it.'

'This one is truly my whole possession, it always gives me contentment. O King for various reasons, I will not give Sabala to you".'

'To there words of Vasishta, Viswamitra who is skilful in conversation reacted with extreme excitement:'

'"I shall give fourteen thousand elephants with gold trappings around the neck and girth,  and with goads made of gold. '

' ', 'I shall give you eight hundred chariots made of gold and decorated with small tinkling bells, each chariot yoked with four white horses. '

' ', 'O Maharshi of auspicious vows I shall give you eleven thousand mighty horses of good breed born in good countries.'

'I shall give one crore young cows of various colours. Give me Sabala.  '

'O Best of brahmins I shall offer you jewels or gold as much as you desire. I shall give you everything. Give this Sabala to me".'

'To these words of sagacious Viswamitra the adorable Vasishta replied: "O King I shall not give Sabala."'

'"This is verily my jewel, my wealth my very life. This is allinall for me.  '

'O King verily this Sabala is useful for my darsa and purnamasa sacrifices, for appropriate gifts and various rites.'

' ', 'O King this (cow) is undoubtedly the source of all my actions. Why these useless ', 'words? I will never give this wishfulfilling cow".', 'इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये बालकाण्डे त्रिपञ्चाशस्सर्ग:।।', 'Thus ends the fiftythird sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.'

'"O Rama when sage Vasishta did not consent to part with the wishfulfilling cow, Viswamitra dragged Sabala by force.'

'O Rama when she was being taken away by the powerful king the distressed Sabala thus reflected choked with sorrow":'

'"I am being carried away by attendants of the king in this greatly distressed and pitiable condition. Have I been abandoned by the magnanimous Vasishta?'

'What harm have I done to the pious maharshi, a compassionate soul? Why does he  forsake me, his auspicious one, despite my innocence and devotion"?    '

'"O Destroyer of enemies thus thinking and repeatedly sighing, that cow shook off those attendants who were in hundreds and ran towards the feet of the illustrious Vasishta with the speed of the wind.'

'Lowing and moaning, standing before Vasishta, roaring like thunder and of kettledrum, Sabala said:'

'"O Brahma\'s son O Venerable one you have abandoned me? For what reason the servants of the king are taking me away from you"? '

'Addressed thus, Bramharshi said to Sabala, like to  a sister whose heart is afflicted with sorrow:'

'"O Sabala I am not forsaking you. You have done me no harm. This highly powerful king is forcibly carrying you away from me.'

'I am no match for his strength, especially he is a king. Being king, he is a warrior, powerful and lord of the earth.'

'He has an entire akshauhini composed of horses, chariots, elephants and banners. Hence he is stonger".'

'To these words of  brahmarshi Vasishta armed with immeasurable power, Sabala, who knew the use of words, replied with humility:'

'"O Best of brahmins it is held that the strength of a kshatriya is no greater than a brahmin\'s. A brahmin possesses great strength his strength is divine. It is greater than that of a kshatriya.'

'Your power is immeasurable. Even though highly valiant, Viswamitra is not greater than you in strength. Your power is unequalled. '

'O Highly fortunate one I am possessed of your brahminic power. Command me. I will destroy the insolent and power of that wickedminded one.'

'O Rama to this, glorious Vasishta replied: "Create an army capable of crushing the enemy power.'

'Hearing his words Kamadhenu created an army. O Rama her lowing brought into being Paplavas in hundreds who destroyed the entire army of Viswamitra, while he looked on helplessly.'

'Thereafter the king (Viswamitra), having seen his army thus routed, flew into a fury. ', 'Wideeyed with anger, he sat in his chariot and destoyed the Paplavas with various kinds of weapons.'

'Having seen hundreds of Paplavas crushed by Viswamitra, once again she created out of anger. Sakas mixed with Yavanas.'

'Sakas mixed with Yavanas, resembling golden filaments possessing brilliance and supreme bravery, covered the earth.'

'Sakas and Yavanas, armed with swords and lances, clad in yellow apparel, looking  like flaming fire destroyed the entire army.'

' ', 'Thereafter, most brilliant Viswamitra released weapons. With these weapons, the Yavanas, Kambhojas and Paplavas were scattered".', 'इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये बालकाण्डे चतुष्पञ्चाशस्सर्ग:।।', 'Thus ends the fiftyfourth sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.'

'Thereafter, Vasishta having seen the forces tortured and overpowered by the weapons of Viswamitra said, "O Kamadhenu create additional forces through your yogic power."'

'"From her lowing Kambhojas bright like the Sun, from the udder Paplavas, weapons in  hand, from the vagina Yavanas, from the anus Sakas, from the roots of the hair Mlecchas along with Kiratas and Haritas were born.'

"O descendant of the Raghus, Viswamitra's army consisting of infantry, elephants, horses, chariots has been entirely destroyed by them instantly.  "

"Having seen the army destroyed by the powerful Vasishta, one hundred sons of Viswamitra became extremely furious and armed with various kinds of weapons rushed towards Vasishta, the best among ascetics. Adorable sage Vasishta, reduced them to ashes with just a 'humkara' (the loud 'hum' sound produced with the mouth)"

'Then one hundred sons of Viswamitra together with their horses, chariots and foot soldiers were reduced to ashes in a moment by the powerful Vasishta.'

'Seeing his sons and army destroyed the illustrious Viswamitra was filled with shame and anxiety.'

' ', 'Like the ocean without waves or the snake bereft of fangs or the Sun eclipsed by Rahu, suddenly (Viswamitra) looked cheerless and dull.'

'Having lost his sons and the army, like a bird with wings clipped, wretched, with pride vanished and confidence shattered Viswamitra fell into despondency.  '

'Viswamitra, having entrusted one of his remaining sons to rule the kingdom in accordance with the kshatriya tradition reached the forest. '

'Mighty ascetic Viswamitra, reached the slopes of the Himavat mountain inhabited by kinnaras and uragas (serpents) and performed  austerities in order to propitiate lord Mahadeva.'

'After some time, lord of the gods, bestower of boons, Maheswara with the symbol of the bull on the banner  appeared before mighty Viswamitra.'

'O King what are you performing the penance for? Tell me what you want? I am bestower of boons. Speak out you desire (said Lord Siva).   '

'Having heard this from the god, Viswamitra who performed the great austerities prostrated before Mahadeva and said these words.'

'O Irreproachable one O Mahadeva if you are pleased with me, make me an expert in Dhanurveda, the science of archery with all it secrets, angas (branches), upangas (subdivisions) and Upanishads.'

'O Irreproachable one whatever weapons are known to devatas, danavas, maharshis, gandharvas, yakshas, rakshasas, be revealed to me. '

"O Lord of the gods by your favour let my desire be fulfilled. Lord Mahadeva having said: 'Be it so' vanished."

'Rajarshi Viswamitra endowed with supreme power became very haughty. Having obtained the weapons, his insolence was greatly accentuated.'

"Like the sea during the full moon, with his increased power (blessed with the invincible strength of the weapons) Viswamitra thought the foremost of ascetics Vasishta was (already) slain. (It shows the height of the king's ignorance and arrogance)."

'Thereafter king Viswamitra having proceeded towards the hermitage (of Vasishta) and released the weapons by the energy of which the entire forest of the ascetics was burnt down.'

'On seeing the weapons discharged by the intelligent Viswamitra saints in hundreds fled in all directions.  '

' ', 'The disciples of Vasishta as well as animals and birds got terrified by the fear and fled in their thousands in all directions. '

"The greatsoul Vasishta's hermitage became deserted and silent in an instant like a barren field."

'Even while Vasistha was repeatedly  assuring  the saints saying "Do not fear, I will now ', 'destroy Viswamitra, son of Gadhi just as the Sun dispels the morning mist (they fled)".  '

'The infuriated Vasishta who was highly brilliant, foremost among those who meditate said to Viswamitra:'

' ', '"O Fool this hermitage has been developed over a long time. Why did you destroy it?  On account of your wickedness you will not live long."'

'Exceedingly furious Vasishta quickly lifted up his staff which looked like the staff of Yama (the od of death), like smokeless fire at the time of destruction of the worlds.', 'इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये बालकाण्डे पञ्चपञ्चाशस्सर्ग:।।', 'Thus ends the fiftyfifth sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.'

"Thus said Vasishta. Mighty Viswamitra lifted up agneya astra (shaft of fire) and discharging it said, 'stay, stay'."

'Venerable Vasishta, in fury lifted the Brahmadanda which was like another rod of death. And spoke these words:    '

'"O wicked kshatriya O son of Gadhi here I stand. Show me your strength and the pride of your arms. I will destroy them now.'

'O mean kshatriya where does your energy of a kshatriya stand in comparison with the great energy of Brahma? Behold my Brahmabala (Brahman\'s energy)". '

"The Brahmadanda (released by Vasishta) put down the dreadful agneya astra released by Gadhi's son just like the force of fire is extinguished by water."

'The incensed son of Gadhi employed varuna, raudra, aindra, pasupata and aishika  weapons. '

'"O Descendent of Raghu Viswamitra employed weapons like manava, mohana, gandharva, swapana, jrimbhana, madana, santapana, vilapana, shoshana, darana, vajra weapons, Brahma, kala and varuna pasas, the favourite painaka, daita, shushka, ardra vajras, danda, paisacha, krauncha, weapons, dharmachakra, kalachakra, vishnuchakras, vayavya, mathana, hayasira weapons, kanakala, musala powers, ', 'vaidyadhara, kalatrishula, kapala, kankana weapons discharged against Vasishta the best of ascetics. All this became aweful.'

'Vasishta son of Brahma, swallowed all those weapons with his staff. When those weapons were humbled, son of Gadhi employed Brahmastra.'

'All the devatas, with Agni in the forefront, divine rishis, great uragas and gandharvas were agitated seeing the Brahmastra raised. When Brahmastra was discharged, the  three worlds became distressed.     '

'O Descendant of Raghu Vasishta who possessed the energy of Brahma swallowed that very dreadful Brahmastra entirely with the help of Brahmadanda.  '

'While swallowing Brahmastra  the great Vasishta looked fierce and  terrible causing the three worlds to faint.  '

"From every pore of the great Vasishta's body flames resembling rays of light with smoke emerged. "

"The staff of Brahma in Vasishta's hand, resembling smokeless fire at the end of the dissolution of the worlds inflamed like another rod of death.  "

'Then hosts of saints praised Vasishta, the best among sages, saying "O Brahmin, your energy is infallible, hold your energy by your enegy".'

"'O Brahman great ascetic Viswamitra was controlled by you. O Best of ascetics be ", "pleased and let the worlds be delivered from distress'."

'At this, Vasishta the most brilliant ascetic became quiet. The humiliated Viswamitra heaved a sigh and spoke these words:'

' ', 'Shame Where is the might of a kshatriya? The energy of a brahmin is the real  energy. The staff of Brahma has singly destroyed all my weapons". '

'"Now I have realised the reason. With clear mind and senses, I shall undertake intense penance which will earn me brahminhood".', 'इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये बालकाण्डे षट्पञ्चाशस्सर्ग:।।', 'Thus ends the fiftysixth sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.'

'"O Descendant of Raghu (Rama) having created enmity between himself and the magnanimous Vasishta, Viswamitra recollecting the disgrace and repeatedly sighing with a distressed heart  went with his eldest wife towards southern quarter to perform  rigorous penance. Subsisting on fruits and roots and his senses underfull control he performed the most rigid austerities. '

Subsisting on fruits and roots and his senses underfull control he performed the most rigid austerities. '

'After some time, four sons, Havishyanda, Madhushyanda, Drudhanetra and Maharatha, who (later) wer wedded to truth and duty, were born."'

'A thousand years passed. The Grandsire of the worlds, Brahma, appeared. He spoke to Viswamitra, the great ascetic, these pleasant words:'

'"O Son of Kushika with your austerities you have won the worlds of the rajarshis. On account of your austerities, you are acknowledged a rajarshi".'

'Having said this the glorious (Brahma), supreme lord of the worlds, left for his abode ', 'in Brahmaloka, in heaven accompanied by the gods.'

'On hearing this Viswamitra hanging down his face a little with shame and anger and grief said:'

'"I have performed intense austerities. Yet rishis and devatas have recognised me only as a rajarshi. I think my penance has yielded fruit. '

' ', '"O Descendant of Kakustha (Rama) this celebrated intellectual having decided in his mind once again performed greater austerities.'

'At this time there lived a celebrated king, renowned in the Ikshvakus race, named Trisanku, who was truthful and self restrained.'

'"O Son of the Raghus (Rama) a thought arose in his mind to enter heaven with his physical body by performing a sacrifice. '

'Summoning Vasishta he (Trisahnku) communicated his intention, but the great Vasishta said it was not possible.'

"Refused by Vasishta, the king went south in order to fulfil his purpose and approached Vasishta's sons.  "

'Most brilliant Trisanku approached the sons of Vasishta in the place where they  had been performing austerities for a long time. There he saw the famous, exceedingly effulgent sons of Vasishta one hundred in number practising penance.'

'The king, having approached all the illustrious sons of his spiritual guide, paid obeisance to them in order of seniority. Bowing down his face in humility and with folded palms, he addressed all those distinguished sons of Vasishta saying:'

'O protectors of those who seek refuge in you, protect me. Wish you well. I have been refused by the great Vasishta.   '

"'I wish to perform a great sacrifice. You are worthy enough to tender your consent. I pay homage to all the sons of my spiritual guide oblige."

"You, brahmins are established in austerity. I bow to you. I beg all of you to direct me with composed minds to direct me in order to attain heaven in physical form'."

'O Ascetocs after having been rejected by Vasishta. I do not see any way other than the sons of my spiritual guide to help me achieve my purpose.'

'For all the descendants of Ikshvakus the spiritual preceptor is the supreme resort for  salvation. Learned spiritual preceptors have always liberated kings.

'"O Rama to these words of king Trisanku, the hundred sons of the sage angrily reacted:'

' ', "'O Evilminded one having been refused by the Guru true to his word, how could you bypass him and approach us who are mere off shoots (of the main)."

'For all the kings of the Ikshvakus race, their chief priest is their Guru. It is not possible ', 'to bypass the spiritual preceptor who is true to his word preceptor.   '

'When an adorable sage like Vasishta has already said, it is not possible, how can we help you conduct such a sacrifice?'

' ', "O Best one among men you are childish. Return to your capital. O Monarch the most venerable Vasishta is capable of conducting sacrifices performed by anybody in the three worlds. How can we dishonour him'?"

'Having heard the confused words uttered by the sages in a state of anger, the king said again:'

'"O Men endowed with the wealth of asceticism I was rejected by my guru and now by his sons. I shall seek another way. Farewell to you".'

'Having seen his fierce intent, the saint\'s sons were infuriated. They cursed him saying, "Be a Chandala" '

'With this the highsouled sons of Vasishta entered their hermitage. And one night after the king became a Chandala (a lowcaste man).'

'The king was tranformed into a darkcomplexioned dirty man with dishevelled hair. His body was besmeared with ashes and on his robes lay wreath collected from the cemetery. He had on him dark (soiled) clothes, and ornaments made of iron.'

'"O Rama seeing him in the form of a chandala, all his counsellors, inhabitants of the city including his followers fled away.'

' ', 'O Descendant of Kakustha wandering alone burning with distress night and day the king went to Viswamitra who was rich in asceticism.'

'O Rama on seeing the king reduced to a useless a chandala, sage Viswamitra was touched with pity".  '

'Exceedingly energetic and deeply pious, he looked at the king who was frightful in appearance and addressed him with compassion saying, "welfare to you". '

'"O Mighty prince what brings your here, for you are the heroic lord of Ayodhya? Whose curse turned you into a chandala"?'

'In response to his words the king,  who had fallen into the state of a chandala yet proficient in expression, spoke to one (Viswamitra) expert in speech, with folded hands.'

'"Rejected by my guru and his sons, what I achieved was disaster and what I could not was the fulfilment of my wish.'

'O Gentle sage it is my intention to enter heaven with my physical body. I performed a hundred sacrifices but  did not reap its fruit.'

'What the king said was proved by his chandala form which the son of Kushika (Viswamitra) heard and out of compassion spoke these sweet words:'

'"O Descendant of Ikshvakus, O child, welcome. I know you as highly righteous. O eminent among kings fear not. I offer you refuge.'

'O king I shall invite pious maharshis to assist you in the sacrifice which you will be able to perform with great relief.'

' ', 'Joining Viswamitra, (in chanting the mantras during the yaga) how will the great brahmins attain heaven after partaking the food offered by of Chandala?'

'O Best among ascetics all the sons of Vasishta along with Mahodaya with their eyes reddened in anger spoke these harsh words": '

'On hearing the words (of the hundred sons of Vasishta uttered in anger) Viswamitra, preeminent among ascetics, spoke furiously with eyes reddened in anger.'

'"I am blameless. I have practised rigorous penance. These wicked ones who have abused (a sage like me) will be reduced to ashes.'

'Caught by the noose of death this day, they shall be brought  to the abode of Yama  and for seven hundred births, feed on corpses.'

' ', 'Reborn as the merciless race of mushtikas, feeding on the flesh of dogs, hideous and deformed, they shall wander in these worlds. '

' ', 'The wicked Mahodaya, who blamed a sage like me so faultless shall be reborn in the race of the nishadas vulnerable to abuse by all.'

'As a consequence of my anger that Mahodaya, devoid of mercy and  taking pleasure in depriving others of their life, will pursue a wretched life for a long time".  '

'The most powerful sage Viswamitra of fierce asceticism fell silent after after uttering ', 'this curse in the assembly of rishis.', 'इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये बालकाण्डे एकोनषष्टितमस्सर्ग:।।', 'Thus ends the fiftyninth sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.'

'The most brilliant Viswamitra, having destroyed the sons of Vasishta including Mahodaya by his ascetic power, said this in the midst of saints:'

' ', '"This religious and generous king born in the Ikshvaku race, wellknown as Trisanku sought my refuge to gain heaven with his physical body,   '

'Join me in the performance of this sacrifice in a manner by which he (Trisanku) attains  heaven with his physical body".'

'Agreeing to these words of Viswamitra all the rishis, knowers of spiritual order and endowed with righteousness assembled there said:'

' ', '"Born in the line of Kusika, this sage is extremely cholerictempered. Whatever he says must be properly carried out. There should be no resitation on this score. The venerable sage is like fire. He will curse us if angered.'

'Hence let the sacrifice be performed in such a manner that the descendant of the Ikshvakus would attain heaven with his physical body through the spiritual power of Viswamitra. All of you commence the sacrifice".'

'The maharshis having resolved performed their respective activities relating to the sacrifice. The brilliant Viswamitra acted as the chief officiating priest.'

'The officiating priests proficient in chanting mantras performed in order of their respective ranks all the rites in accordance with the Yojanakalpa adhering to codes and traditions.'

'Long after, the mighty ascetic Viswamitra  invoked all the gods to partake their share of offerings.'

'When, the gods invited by him did not come to receive their share of offerings, the great ascetic Viswamitra seized with anger lifted the sacrificial ladle and said to Trisanku:'

'"O King behold the prowess of my selfearned asceticism. With my spiritual might, I shall send you to heaven with your physical body O King go to heaven with physical body which is not possible for anybody to accomplish.'

'By the power of what little fruit of austerities I have earned, I shall send to heaven with your body".'

' ', '"O Descendant of Kakustha (Rama) when the sage had said these words, the king with his physical body ascended to heaven in the presence of the sages. '

'On ascending to heaven Trisanku saw Indra (destroyer of Paka) along with hosts of  gods. Indra said to him:'

'"O Trisanku you are not fit to inhabit heaven. Go back, you fool Doomed by the curse of your spiritual preceptor, fall on earth, head down.'

'Thus spoken to by Indra, Trisanku crying, "O Viswamitra, Protect me, Protect me" started falling down.'

' ', 'Having heard the wailing Trisanku, the enraged Viswamitra shouted, "Stay, Stay".'

'Standing in the midst of the ascetics, that  mighty sage who conjured up a constellation of seven new rishis (stars) looked like another creator Brahma. Overcome by anger the illustrious sage created a new group of stars in the southern direction.   '

'Having created a constellation of stars, Viswamitra out of anger said, "I will create  another Indra or this world will be without Indra" and commenced to create even gods.'

'Struck with wonder and fear, hosts of rishis, suras and asuras humbly addressed Viswamitra.'

'"O Glorious maharshi, this king cursed by his spiritual preceptor is not worthy of going to heaven with his physical body". \t'

'The son of Kushika (Viswamitra), the preeminent ascetic heard the gods and said these praiseworthy words:'

'At this time Ambarisha, a wellknown king of Ayodhya, launched preparations for a  sacrifice.    '

'While he was performing the sacrifice Indra stole away the sacrificial animal. The animal could not be traced. Hence the priest said to the king:'

'O Dear Rama, the delight of Raghu clan the king scoured countries, villages, cities, forests, sacred hermitages till he saw sage Richika in the Bhrigutunda mountain sitting with his sons and wie. '

'The most brilliant king(Ambarisha) bowing to sage Richika, a brahmarshi who looked extremely resplendent with penance, propitiated him, enquired about the welfare of all and finally said":'

'"O Fortunate descendent of the Bhrigu race if your son is sold as a sacrificial animal in exchange for a hundred thousand cows, my purpose will be answered.'

'I have roamed all countries but could not final the sacrificial animal. Should\'nt you spare one of your sons for a price"?'

'Thus addressed the exceedingly brilliant Richika said, "O Best among men in no way shall I sell my first born". '

'Having heard Richika, the miserable mother of great sons, addressed Ambarisha, the foremost of men, saying:'

'Venerable descendant of the Bhrugus (sage Richika) said that the eldest son cannot be sold. "O King the youngest son, Sunaka, is my beloved son. You know, O King for that reason I will not give my yougest son".'

'"O Best among men generally, the eldest sons are the favourites of their fathers, the youngest their mothers: For that reason, I shall keep my youngest son.'

'O Rama the sage and his wife having spoken thus, their middle son Sunassepha said on his own:'

'O King my father says his eldest son cannot be sold, mother says that her  youngest son cannot be spared. From this I think middle son is already sold away. Therefore, take me"'

'"O Delight of the Raghus (Rama) having purchased Sunassepha for a hundred thousands of cows the king refurned immensely pleased.'

'O Foremost of men, O Delight of the Raghus (Rama) the illustrious king (Ambarisha) took Sunassepha with him. (On the way) at Pushkara he took some rest at noon.'

'While the king was resting at Pushkara, the famous Sunassepha, very much distressed, happened to see his maternal uncle Viswamitra in the company of other sages performing austerities.'

"With his face discoloured due to thirst and fatigue, he (Sunassepha) immediately fell into the sage's lap in a pitiable condition and said:"

'"O Noble man O Preeminent among ascetics I have no mother nor father nor friends nor relatives. You should protect me according to dharma.'

"O Best among ascetics you are the protecor of everybody. You are promoter of others' welfare. May the king fulfil his purpose. May I live long and become immortal and attain heaven after performing great penance. May I enjoy heaven."

'O Virtuous one with a kind heart protect this orphan. Like a father who protects his son, save me from this peril".  '

'Having heard Sunassepha, mighty ascetic Viswamitra consoled him in many ways and said to his sons:'

' '

'O sons of the sage this young boy has sought my protection. O Sons you may grant him his desire by merely offering your life.'

'Engaged in the observance of righteousness, all of you have done virtuous deeds. By becoming sacrificial animals for the king, you may satisfy Agni.'

'Then Sunassepha will be protected. The king\'s sacrifice will continue without hindrance. The gods will be gratified. My words also will come true".'

'"O Best of men (Rama) in response to the words of the sage Madhuchanda and others said thus in a casual way with selfesteem.'

'O Lord protecting other\'s son by abandoning one\' own is like partaking the flesh of a dog. We consider it a prohibited act".'

'On hearing the words of his sons Viswamitra, the eminent ascetic, eyes reddened with anger began to speak:'

' ', '"(You have) not only trangressed my words but also (you are) censurable according to dharma. You have uttered such audacious and dreadrul words causing the hair to stand on end.'

'All of you shall live on earth for a thousand years, like the sons of Vasishta feeding on the flesh of dogs".'

'Viswamitra the best of ascetics, thus cursed his sons. Sunassepha, (now) was filled with distress. To relieve him of his pain he said:'

'"Bedaubing your person with red sandal paste and adorned with red garlands, you will ', 'be bound to a Vaishnava, sacrificial post with sacred ropes. There invoke Agni with these hymns.'

'O Son of sage chant thse two sacred mantras in the sacrifice of Ambarisha.There after you will achieve success (long life)".'

' ', 'Sunassepha memorized the two verses with concentration of mind and hastened towards Amabarisha, a lion among kings. And said:'

'"Endowed with great strength, you are a lion among kings. We shall go to the sacrificial assembly without delay. O Indra among monarchs, take up initiatory rites ', 'and  perform the sacrifice".'

"At the words of the sage's son, the king, eager with delight hastened towards the sacrificial ground."

'With the consent of the officiating priests the king invested Sunasepha with the sacred symbols with Kusa grass, dressed him in red apparel and tied him to the sacrificial post as a sacrificial animal. '

'Thus bound, the son of the sage praised the two devatas, Indra and Upendra with moving words.'

'"O Descendant of Raghu (Rama) Indra, gratified with the secret hymn granted Sunassepha long life.'

'O Foremost of men O Rama the king also obtained from the sacrifics innumerable rewards by the grace of Indra several times greater than expected.'

'O Best among men the righteous and mighty ascetic Viswamitra also continued his austerities at Pushkara for a thousand years".', 'इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये बालकाण्डे द्विषष्टितमस्सर्ग:।।', 'Thus ends the sixtysecond sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.'

'All the gods wanted to bestow the fruits of austerties on the mighty ascetic (Viswamitra). They approached him after a thousand years of penace and his final ritual bath. '

'Exceedingly effulgent Brahma spoke to him, "You have become a rishi through the selfearned sacred deeds. Fare you well".  '

'Brahma, the lord of the gods, having said this returned to heaven. The brilliant Viswamitra continues his austerities.'

'"O Foremost of men after a long lapse of time a chief nymph called Menaka came to bathe at Pushkara.'

'There the most brilliant son of Kusika Viswamitra saw Menaka whose beauty was incomparable. She looked like lightning in the clouds.'

'On seeing her (Menaka) Viswamitra came under the influence of the god of love (fell in love with her). He said, O Apsara welcome to my hermitage stay here. I am infatuated with you: Oblige me. Wish you well.'

'"O Descendant of Raghu while that woman of an exalted race lived in the hermitage of Viswamitra, ten years rolled by happily".'

'As the period passed, Viswamitra the mighty ascetic was filled with grief, anxiety and ', 'remorse.'

"O Delight of the Raghus (Rama) a sense of indignation filled the mind of the ascetic. 'All this is the conspiracy of the gods to deprive me of my great austerities', he thought."

' ', 'Night and day deluded by lust I have wasted ten years. A hindrance has been posed (to my tapas).'

'"O Rama Viswamitra, the best of ascetics sighed with repentance, distressed with grief. On seeing him, the apsara started trembling in fear. She stood before him with folded palms. (But) with sweet words the son of Kushika left her and proceeded ', 'towards the northern mountains. '

'Illustrious Viswamitra took a vow of celibacy in order to control his senses. And performed rigid austerities on reaching the bank of river Kausiki.'

'O Rama while he was performing rigorous penance for a thousand years on the northern mountains, the gods were gripped with fear. (lest he should exceed them).'

' ', 'After consultations the gods and sages decided that this son of Kushika (Viswamitra)  deserved the status of a Maharshi".  '

'Having heard the gods, the Grandsire of the worlds (Brahma) addressed  Viswamitra whose wealth was his ascetism in these sweet words.'

' ', '"O Maharshi O Child welcome Pleased with your intense austerities, O Son of Kushika I confer upon you the eminent rank of a great rishi (maharshi)".'

'Having heard the words Brahman, the lord of all the worlds, Viswamitra whose wealth was his asceticism was neither dejected nor delighted.'

' ', 'Then the mighty ascetic Viswamitra bowed to Brahma, the Grandsire of all the worlds with folded hands and replied:'

'"O Adorable one, if you have conferred the incomparable title of \'Maharshi\' earned by my auspicious deeds, I feel I have conquered the senses."'

"Then Brahma said to him, 'You have not conquered the senses yet. O Tiger among ", "ascetics, strive still.' Having said this he went toward heaven."

' ', 'After the departure of the gods, mighty ascetic Viswamitra raised his arms up, stood without support, subsisting on air, continuing with his austerities.  '

' ', 'Viswamitra whose wealth was his penance carried on his rigid austerities for a thousand years amidst five fires, in summer, under the open sky in monsoon, and   immersed in ater night and day in winter.'

' ', 'When the mighty asetic Viswamitra was peforming penance, the gods as well as Indra  got deeply perturbed. '

'Indra along with all the maruts spoke to the celestial nymph Rambha, words that augured well for them and not for kaushika (Viswamitra).', 'इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये बालकाण्डे त्रिषष्टितमस्सर्ग:।।', 'Thus ends the sixtythird sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.'

'"O Rambha you must entice Viswamitra by lust and passion. This important work ', 'must be done by you in the interest of the gods". '

'O Rama, to these words of the sagacious, thousandeyed Lord of the gods (Indra) that apsara with folded hands bashfully replied:'

' ', "'Lord of the devatas this mighty ascetic Viswamitra is a terrible person. He will ceratinly release on his dreadful anger (curse me). O Lord this is my apprehension. You should excuse me'."

'O Rama having heard Rambha trembling in fear and standing with folded palms, Indra spoke:'

"'O Rambha have no fear. Feel safe. Carry out my order. When the trees look so beautiful in spring I shall in captivating the form of a cuckoo, stay by your side in the company of Kamadeva (Cupid)."

' ', "O Rambha displaying many (romantic) gestures and assuming a fascinating form, distract the mighty ascetic, Kausika (Viswamitra)'."

'At these words (of Indra), Rambha, assumed any form of excellent beauty and with a bright smile set out to allure Viswamitra.'

'Excited by the charming warble of the cuckoo, Viswamitra opened his eyes.'

'On hearing the sound of the incomparable song of the cuckoo along with the  sight of Rambha, a doubt arose in the mind of the ascetic.'

'Son of Kushika, the eminent ascetic knew it was the work of Indra. Seized with anger, ', 'he cursed Rambha: '

"'O luckless Rambha, since you have endeavoured to distract me from my desire to conquer  wrath and passion, you shall turn into a rock and remain so for ten thousand years'."

"'O Rambha an effulgent brahmin, endowed with the power of asceticism, will liberate you from this state into which you have fallen on account of my anger'. "

' ', 'The brilliant Viswamitra, the great ascetic, now experienced remorse for his inability to contain anger.'

'This mighty curse, of the great saint transformed Rambha into a rock and sent Kamadeva and Indra to their heels.'

'"O Rama highly powerful Viswamitra was deprived of his ascetic merit due to his ', 'anger. He had no peace of mind for his inability to control his senses.'

'Having been deprived of his ascetic merit, he resolved not to lose his temper nor ever breathe a word".'

' ', '"Further, I shall not even inhale for hundreds of years. I shall conquer my senses and dry up this body.'

'Until brahminhood is obtained by my austerities, I shall stay without breathing or eating for innumerable years. While performing penance, my limbs shall not undergo deterioration". '

'"O Descendant of Raghu in this way that eminent ascetic took an unprecedented vow to practise penance for a thousand years".   ', 'इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये बालकाण्डे चतुष्षष्टितमस्सर्ग:।। ', 'Thus ends the sixtyfourth sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.'

'"O Rama thereafter the great ascetic (Viswamitra), abandoning the north of the Himavat mountain reached the eastern quarter and performed rigorous austerities.'

'Having observed a unique vow of silence for a thousand years, O Rama he practised unprecedented and extremely difficult austerities. '

'After completion of a thousand years the great ascetic became a piece of wood. In spite of many impediments, he was unshaken, anger did not enter into his mind. O Rama with firm determination he practised  austerities.'

'O Best of Raghus dynasty (Rama) when the thousandyearold vow was over (Viswamitra) the great practitioner of vows began to partake cooked rice. At this moment Indra assumed the guise of a brahmin and asked him for the rice (he was going to eat).'

'This mighty, adorable ascetic having adopted a vow of silence decided to give all the cooked rice to the Brahmin. The brahmin finished all the rice. Viswamitra went without food but did not utter a single word to the brahmin. Thereafter the distinguished ascetic practised austerities for another period of thousand years, his breath suspended.'

'While his breath, was suspended, smoke emanated from his head which frightened the three worlds. It appeared as though they were on fire. '

'Thereupon devatas along with gandharvas, pannagas, uragas, and rakshasas, stood bewildered by his ascetic energy. Their own glory was dimmed in his lustre". Afflicted with anguish, they spoke to the Grandsire (Brahma):'

'"O Lord the great sage Viswamitra was lured and angered in various ways. But his austerities continued to grow:'

' ', 'His penance was flawless. If his wishes were not granted, he will  surely destroy by his austerities the three worlds with all movables and immovables.'

'There is bewilderment everywhere. It is dark all over. The oceans are disturbed. The mountains have cracked.'

'O Brahma the earth trembles. The wind blows fiercely. The people have ceased to believe in God. We do not know the way out.'

'The people of all the three worlds are agitated and confused in mind. The Sun, too, looks pale before the brilliance of the Maharshi.'

' ', 'O Lord before this mighty, venerable ascetic, effulgent like fire decides to destroy the three worlds, he should be appeased.'

'All the three worlds are burning as though with the fire Pralaya (dissolution). His desire may be granted even if he wants to rule the kingdom of the gods.'

'Thereafter, with Brahma in the forefront, the gods spoke to Viswamitra in pleasing words:'

' ', '"Welcome, O Brahmarshi. We are immensely pleased with your austerities. O Kausika you have attained brahminhood by means of your intense penance.  '

'O Brahmana I along with the maruts grant you long life. May you prosper O Gentle one now you may go happily".'

'Mighty ascetic Viswamitra was delighted to hear the words of the Grandsire and the gods. Bowing to all of them he thus spoke:'

'"If brahminhood and long life have been acquired by me by your grace, Omkara, Vashatkara and the Vedas shall accept me as Brahmarshi. (I shall acquire the right to interpret the Vedas and to perform sacrifices.)'

'"O gods let the son of Brahma and eminent Vasishta who is knowledgeable in the vedas worthy of brahmins and archery worthy of kshatriyas address me as \'Brahmarshi\'. If this supreme desire is granted, O Best of devatas all of you can go".'

'Thereupon, pleased by the gods, Vasishta, the best among ascetics, lovingly said to Viswamitra "You are a Brahmarshi, let it be so". '

'"You are a Brahmarshi, no doubt. You will achieve ascetic perfection", said the gods ', 'and returned to their respective places from where they had come.'

'Virtuous Viswamitra also, having attained excellent brahminhood, worshipped  Brahmrshi Vasishta who was the best of those who recite hymns".'

'This illustrious sage having fulfilled his desire, wandered over the earth fixed in asceticism. O Rama  thus he acquired brahminhood. '

'O Rama he is the foremost of ascetics, an embodiment of asceticism, always intent on virtue. He is the ultimate repository of ascetic energy". '

'Having thus spoken, the most brilliant and best among brahmins (Satananda) became silent. In the presence of Rama and Lakshmana, Janaka listened to the words of Satananda. And with folded palms said to the son of Kushika (Viswamitra):'

'"O Righteous one O Preeminent among ascetics you have come to my sacrifice accompanied by the descendants of Kakustha (Rama and Lakshmana). I am  blessed by your presence and am   highly favoured.'

'O Excellent ascetic O Brahmana I am sanctified with your presence. I have derived immense benefits from your visit.'

'O powerful  Brahmarshi distinguished Rama and I have heard your great austerities which were related in detail (by Satananda).'

' ', 'Many of your virtues have been heard by the members of the assembly present at the  sacrifice. Your austerities are immeasurable, your power is immense. O Son of Kushika (Viswamitra), your virtues cannot be measured.'

' ', 'O Lord I am never tired of listening to your marvellous deeds. O Excellent among ascetics the Sun has set and it is time for evening prayers. '

' ', 'O Sage of great austerities come to me tomorrow at dawn. O Excellent ascetic welcome And allow me to leave".'

' ', 'The day dawned bright and clear when the king (Janaka) performed his daily routine rites and welcomed the great Viswamitra with the two Raghavas (Rama and Lakshmana). '

'The virtuous Janaka paid respects to Viswamitra and the highsouled Rama and Lakshmana in accordance with the sastras and spoke:'

'"Welcome, O Venerable one O Irreproachable one what can I do for you? Worthy of being commanded, I seek your orders.'

'At the words of the magnanimous Janaka, the virtuous sage wellversed in speech replied to the heroic king:'

"Dasaratha's sons, (Rama and Lakshmana), kshatriyas renowned in the world are eager to see that great bow in your possession."

'Be blessed. Show this great bow to the princes. This is their desire. Once it is fulfilled, they will go back.'

'Thus addressed by the mighty ascetic Janaka replied, "I shall tell you how this bow came to be deposited here".   '

'"O Adorable one there was a famous king named Devarata, sixth in line from Nimi. This bow was kept with him in trust by the exalted lord (Shiva).'

"Earlier at the time of destruction of Daksha's sacrifice, Rudra endowed with  great ", 'prowess lifted this bow sportively and spoke to the gods.'

"'O gods in your anxiety to partake your share of the sacrifie, you have failed to provide mine in the sacrificial offerings. Therefore, I shall sever your jewelled heads and beautiful limbs with this bow'.  "

'"O Eminent ascetic thereafter all the gods with agitated minds propitiated lord of the gods, Siva and he was pleased with them.'

'O Lord that gem of a bow belonging to Siva was given to the great gods who in turn got it deposited in trust with our ancestor.  '

'Thereupon while I was ploughing and cleaing the (sacrificial) ground, Sita, a wellknown name, was lifted up by the blade of the plough. Thus she was obtained by ', 'me.'

"Arisen from the earth and not from a mother's womb, she grew up as my daughter. I made a stipulation that (this shall be the means to win this maiden as a gift) this shall be given in marriage only to the prince whose prowess is fully tried."

' ', 'O Eminent ascetic arisen from the earth and reared as my daughter, she has been sought after in marriage by many princes. '

"O Worshipful one all those monarchs sought this maiden but I did not offer my daughter saying that the 'marriage offer' could be made only through the tried and tested prowess of a suitor."

' ', 'O Preeminent among ascetics thereafter many kings together came to Mithila to test their prowess.'

' ', 'The bow was brought and placed before those who were curious to test their strength ', 'but none was able to grasp or lift the bow.'

' ', 'O great ascetic I knew those mighty kings had little strength, so rejected them.'

'O Mighty ascetic, thereafter all the kings doubting their own strength in stringing the bow were inflamed with anger and laid siege on Mithila.  '

' ', 'Those eminent kings felt humiliated. Inflamed with anger, they tormented the city of Mithila. '

' ', 'O Best among ascetics thus one year passed. Everywhere in the city all the means of living were exhausted. I felt deeply sad over this situation. '

'Thereafter, I propitiated the gods by my austerities. Highly pleased, they gave me an army of four divisions (chariots, elephants, horses and infantry ). '

'Then those wicked kings who were exhausted were doubtful about their energy. They were beaten and defeated. They fled away along with their ministers in different directions.'

'O Sage you are a tiger among asceties, you are faithful to your vows, I shall show this effulgent bow to your Rama and Lakshmana . '

' ', 'O Sage if Rama could lift and string this bow I shall give my daughter Sita, not born from a woman, to him (son of Dasaratha)".

'At the words of Janaka, great ascetic Viswamitra said to the king, "Let the bow be shown to Rama".'

' ', 'Thereafter king Janaka said to his feudatories, "Let the divine bow adorned with flowers and sandalpaste be brought".'

' ', 'Commanded by (king) Janaka, the ministers went to the city, put the bow in front of them and carried it as per the orders of the king.'

'Five thousand mighty stalwarts drew with great difficulty the eightwheeled cart on which the bow was placed in a box.'

'The counsellors of the king, brought the iron casket containing the bow and said these words to Janaka comparable to a celestial:'

' ', "'O Indra among kings O lord of Mithila here is the great bow, worshipped by all kings, ", "which you intend to show (to Rama)'."

'Having heard this, the king with folded hands said to the great soul Viswamitra sitting with the two princes Rama and Lakshmana:'

'"O Brahman in the olden days, this great bow was worshipped by my forefathers. Powerful kings failed to string this bow. '

'Hosts of devatas, asuras, rakhasas, kinnaras and great serpents, the best of gandharvas and yakshas, also failed (to wield this bow).'

'How then can men bend, string, fix the arrow, pull the string and lift it? '

' ', 'O Eminent ascetic such heaviest bow is brought here, O Highly accomplished sage show this to the two princes".'

'Having heard the words of Janaka, the righteous Viswamitra said: "O Child O Descendant of Raghu look at this bow".'

'At the words of the great rishi Viswamitra, Rama opened the casket, beheld  the bow and said:'

'"O Brahmarshi, shall I touch this great bow with my hands lift and string it".'

' ', 'The king as also the rishi said "Be it so". At the words of the sage (Viswamitra), he (Rama) took hold of the bow by the its middle with ease:'

'Virtuous Rama, the delight of the Raghus, in the presence of several thousands of men fixed the string to the bow and drew it as though with ease.'

' ', 'Rama, the best among men, righteous and famous lifted the bow. Stringing it with a twang he drew it and broke it into two in the middle.'

'It generated a loud sound like the clap of thunder, like the trembling of the earth and the splitting of a mountain.'

'On hearing the sound, except Janaka, Viswamitra and the two raghavas (Rama and Lakshmana) the rest of the people around fell down and fainted.'

'When the people recovered the king skilful in the use  of words addressed the eminent ascetic  without apprehension with folded palms in the following words: '

'"O Worshipful one I have witnessed the prowess of Rama, son of Dasaratha. I had not ', 'imagined that this marvellous feat could be ever accomplished.'

' ', 'By receiving Rama, son of Dasaratha, as her husband, my daughter Sita will bring glory to my dynasty. '

"O Son of Kausika I announce Sita to be the 'Reward of prowess'. My vow has come true. She is more valuable than my life and fit to be given to Rama."

'O Brahmarshi Kausika, be blessed With your consent my ministers will take the chariots to Ayodhya immediately.'

'That Sita, the reward of prowess is to be given to Rama be reventially communicated in detail to king Dasaratha and he may be conveyed here.'

' ', 'The welfare of the descendant of Kausika (Rama and Lakshmana) under the protection of sage (Viswamitra) be reported to the king. The king who will be happy to hear this ', 'be brought here by swiftfooted men".'

' ', 'Reaching the king\'s palace the messengers said to the doorkeepers, "Let king ', 'Dasaratha be immediately informed that the messengers from Janaka have come".'

"Having heard their words, the doorkeepers informed the descendant of Raghu (king Dasaratha). Thereafter, with the the king's permission, the messengers entered the royal palace  and beheld the aged king Dasaratha who shone like a god."

'All the messengers, hands folded free from apprehensions, reverentially addressed the king in sweet words.'

'"O Great monarch Mithila\'s lord, king Janaka, with the sacred fire in front again and again enquires about your health and the spiritual wellbeing of your preceptors, priests and attendants in words filled with sweetness and affection.'

'Janaka, the king of Mithila with the enquiry about your welfare, with the permission of the son of Kausika (Viswamitra) sends you this message:'

'O King It is wellknown that formerly I had vowed to give my daughter to a groom as a reward for prowess. Disappointed when proved powerless, the kings became indignant and opposed me.'

'O King that this daughter of mine has been won by your heroic son Rama  who has come here casually led by Viswamitra.'

'O Great king, Dasaratha the divine bow with its limitless glory was broken in the middle by the great self Rama in the assembly of people.'

'Sita is fit to be given in marriage to this eminent Rama as a reward for his prowess. I request you to give your consent to fulfil my vow.'

'O Indra among kings you will not only bring me pleasure, you will also be happy to see your sons.'

' ', 'The king of Videha (Janaka) with Viswamitra\'s approval and in line with Satananda\'s thinking has conveyed these sweet words". The messengers having said so concluded  out of respect for their king (afraid that they might look overtalkative).'

'Exceedingly happy to hear the words of the messengers, the king said to Vasishta, Vamadeva and other ministers. '

' ', '"The enhancer of the joy of Kausalya (Rama) along with hs brother Lakshmana under the protection of  Viswamitra  is now staying in the coutry of the Videhas."'

' ', 'Illustrious Janaka desires to bestow his daughter on the descendat of Kakustha (Rama) whose prowess he has witnessed.      '

'Ready at the altar, I have been awaiting you, O King Without hindrance proceed Why delay?".'

'Thereafter the king of the Videhas to Vasishta, "O Adherent of righteousness, O Lord O Maharshi perform with the rishis the marriage ceremony of Rama who causes delight to the three worlds".   '

'Venerable and renowned ascetic Vasishta said "Be it so".And with Viswamitra and virtuous Satananda in the forefront, an altar was duly improvised in the centre of the sacrificial pavilion.

'Then king Janaka sprinkled on Sita waters sanctified by mantras, and immersed in delight said:'

'"Lakshmana come and accept my daughter. Urmila ready to be bestowed upon you ', 'by me. Take her hand. Let there be no delay".'

'Janaka, having spoken thus to Lakshmana addressed Bharata: "O Descendant of the Raghus hold Mandavi\'s hand in your own".  '

'O Descendants of Kakustha (Rama, Lakshmana, Bharata and Satrughna) you all are gentle. You possess sound character. You are true to your vows. Live with your wives. Let there be no delay". '

'Night over, the great ascetic Viswamitra, profusely blessed the princes born in the race of Raghu, took leave of the two kings and set out towards the northern (Himalayas) mountains. '

'With the departure of Viswamitra, king Dasaratha who was the source of happiness to his subjects took leave of Janaka, king of Mithila and speedily set out for the city of Ayodhya.'

'King Dasaratha of Ayodhya also left along with his great sons preceded by the sages and followed by the army.'

'While this tiger among men Dasaratha, was returning with the hosts of sages and his sons, he observed here and there frightening birds making disagreeable sounds.  '

' ', 'Seeing the beasts on the way rushing to the right the tiger among men, enquired of Vasishta:'

'"While the frightening birds are inauspicious, the deer on the right are favourables Why is this? My heart beats. My mind is depressed.'

'To these words of king Dasaratha the great ascetic Vasishta replied in a gentle voice, "I shall tell you the consequences Listen". '

'The dreadful cries from the mouths of birds foretell an event of celestial nature likely to befall but the movements other of deer indicate restoration of peace. Therefore do not grieve.'

'While they were conversing, a storm blew, shaking the earth and felling down beautiful trees. '

'The Sun was wrapped in dark. The quarters were devoid of brightness. The entire army was covered with ashes, as if they fainted. '

'At that time Vasishta and other saints, the king and his sons held their senses under control. All others lost their consciousness.'

'In that dreadful darkness while the army looked as if covered with ashes, king Dasaratha encountered the repressor of kings, descendant of Bhrugu and son of Jamadagni with a terrible crown of matted hair, inaccessible like Kailasa mountain and unendurable like the fire at the time of dissolution. The laymen gazing at his blazing energy,hanging an axe on his shoulder and holding a bow in his hand which flashed like lighning and the principal arrow he looked like Siva at the time of slaying of ', 'Tripura.'

'At the sight of the fearful appearance of Parasurama looking like flaming fire, Vasishta and all other saints who were in the habit of chanting mantras and offering oblations to the fire whispered among themselves:'

'Enraged at the slaughter of his father (by Kartaveeryarjuna), is he intent upon  exterminating the kshatriya race? Having slaughtered the kshatriyas, in the past he was freed from anger and grief. Is he again desirous of annihilating the kshatriyas? '

'The saints having thus talked amongst themselves, offered arghya to the son of Bhargava, of dreadful appearance and addressed him in soothing words: "O Rama O Rama". '

' ', 'Valiant Parasurama, son of Jamadagni, having accepted the homage offered by the saints addressed Rama, son of Dasaratha and said:', 'इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये बालकाण्डे चतुस्सप्ततितमस्सर्ग:।।', 'Thus ends the seventyfourth sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic ', 'composed by sage Valmiki.'

'"O Rama, Rama, son of Dasaratha I have heard in full of your marvellous prowess and your feat in breaking the bow of Siva.  '

"The fact that you have broken Siva's bow is an astonishing act. It is beyond imagination. Having heard it I have come here with another auspicious bow."

'This mighty, dreadful bow was obtained through Jamadagni. You may display your prowess by fixing on it an arrow. '

'O Rama after witnessing your strength in stretching and stringing this bow, I shall engage you in a duel acclaiming your prowess".'

'When king Dasaratha heard these words, his face fell. He humbly pleaded with him his hands folded:'

'"You are a brahmana, highly renowned and withdrawn from anger against kshatriyas. It behoves of you to give assurance of security to my sons who are young. '

'Born in the family of (saint) Bhrigu versed in the study of the Vedas and  observance of vows. You have promised in the name of  the thousandeyed Indra to renounce the arms.'

'By adhering to righteousness in life and having conferred the earth upon Kasyapa, you retired to the forest and made your residence on the Mahendra mountain.'

'O Great ascetic today you have arrived evidently for the total destruction of our family. ', 'If Rama is killed none of us will survive".'

'Disregarding these words of Dasaratha, the valiant son of Jamadagni said to Rama.'

'"These two excellent celestial bows are wellknown throughout the worlds. They are stout and strong. They are the best of all, wellmade by Visvakarma.'

'O Best among men O Descendant of Kakustha one of these broken by you, was given by the gods to the threeeyed Siva, who, wishing to fight the demon Tripura with this bow, destroyed him.'

'This second bow which is unassailable was given by chief of the celestials to Visnu. O Rama born in the race of Kakutstha this highly radiant bow of Visnu is as strong as the bow of Siva.'

'Then all the gods in order to ascertain the strength and weakness of Siva and Visnu enquired of the Grandsire, Brahma:'

'Foremost among the truthful, Grandsire Brahma come to know the intention of the ', 'gods and triggered a conflict between the gods.'

"In that thrilling fight between Siva and Visnu, each desirous of victory over the other, a ferocious battle took place causing one's hair to stand on end.  "

"Then, with the 'Humkara' produced by Visnu, Siva's bow of dreadful prowess was stretched, which struck the threeeyed Mahadeva motionless."

'Then hosts of sages, charanas and the gods assembled there and beseeched both of them, the preeminent among the gods to keep peace.'

"Now that the bow of Siva was made inert by Visnu's prowess, hosts of sages and  gods acknowlged Visnu as superior."

'Glorious Siva, enraged at this, placed the bow together with the arrow in the hands of Rajarshi Devarata in the country of Videha. '

'This bow of Visnu, O Rama capable of conquering hostile cities, was given in trust to Richika belonging to the race of Bhrigu. '

'Brilliant Ruchika gave this bow to his son, the great Jamadagni, my father, a man of unrivalled valour. '

'My father equipped with ascetic energy renounced the weapon and was killed by Kartaveeryarjuna in a vulgar manner.  '

'O Rama Having heard the slaying of my father incomparable in extreme ruthlessness, ', 'I decimated the Kshatriya race again and again out of fury as they were born and reborn. I conquered the entire earth. At the conclusion of the sacrifice I conferred it on the great soul Kasyapa of meritorious acts. Gifted with ascetic energy I have (now) made the Mahendra mountain my abode.  '

'O Mighty Rama when I heard that you have broken the bow with your extraordinary prowess, I have come here quickly.'

'Respect the duties of a kshatriya, O Rama Take hold of this great, uncommon bow of Visnu inherited by me from my father and forefathers.'

'O Descendant of Kakustha this best bow is capable of conquering enemy cities. Fix an arrow. If it is possible for you to do so, then I shall engage you in a duel".', 'इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये बालकाण्डे पञ्चसप्ततितमस्सर्ग: ।।', 'Thus ends the seventyfifth sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.'

'Hearing the words of the son of Jamadagni (Parasurama), Rama, the son of Dasaratha, avoiding further conversation out of respect for his father intercepted Parasurama saying: '

' ', '"O Descendant of Bhrigu I have listened to the (marvellous) acts you have performed. O Brahman I commend you for discharging your duty in repaying the debt to your father.'

'You underrate me O Bhargava as though I am devoid of valour and incompetent to perform the duties of a Kshatriya. Now witness my energy and valour.'

' ', "Having spoken thus, the enraged Rama, gifted with quick vigour, seized the bow and arrow from Parasurama's hands."

'Infuriated Rama bent the bow stretched it, fixed the arrow and addressed Parasurama, the son of Jamadagni:'

'"You are a brahmin, O Parasurama. You are also related to Viswamitra. Hence you are worthy of homage. I cannot, therefore, release this against you to take your life.  '

'I shall destroy your mobility, O Parasurama or the higher worlds earned through your matchless asceteic energy. Tell me which one you choose.'

'On conquering the hostile cities and destroying the pride and strength of the enemy ', 'by its prowess, this celestial arrow of Visnu shall not go in vain".'

'The gods with the Grandsire, Brahma in the forefront, accompanied by sages in groups assembled there to see Rama holding that mighty bow. Gandharvas, apsaras, siddhas, charanas, kinnaras, yakshas, rakshsas and nagas also came there to witness that great wonder.'

'Then when Rama stretched the great bow, the world became motionless. The son of Jamadagni, Parasurama, bereft of prowess gazed at him with astonishment.'

"His energy subdued by Rama's prowess, the paralysed, Parasurama, son of Jamadagni spoke in gentle words to him whose eyes resembled the lotus petals:"

'"When I gave this entire earth to Kasyapa, he said to me, \'you shall not live in my country\'. '

'O Descendant of Kakustha having gifted this earth to Kasyapa, I promised him that I would not live here, during night time. For the earth belongs to him.'

'For this, you should not destroy my mobility, O valiant son of the Raghus. I shall go to Mahendra, the best of mountains, with the speed of mind.'

'Strike with the, principal arrow the unrivalled worlds conquered by my asceticism. Do not delay, O Rama'

'By the fact that you have stretched this bow, I have come to know that you are Visnu, Lord of the gods, slayer of Madhu, O Imperishable one O Tormentor of enemies Fare well.'

'All your deeds are incomparable. You are unassailable in combat. All these hosts of gods have assembled here and are looking at you. '

'I have been defeated by you, O Descendant of Kakustha lord of the three worlds. Therefore, it is not right for me to feel ashamed. '

'You are faithful to vows O Rama This arrow has no equal in prowess. It behoves of you to release it against me. After its release I shall go to the excellent Mahendra  mountain". '

'Thus spoke  Parasurama, son of Jamadagni to Rama, the valiant son of Dasaratha who (then) discharged the principal arrow. '

'Having witnessed the destruction of those regions earned by him through asceticism, the son of Jamadagni left for the best of mountains Mahendra.'

'Thereafter all the quarters including the intermediaries were cleared of darkness. Hosts of sages and gods extolled Rama when he wielded the bow.'

'Parasurama, the competent son of Jamadagni, having praised Rama, the son of ', 'Dasaratha circumbulated him and left for his abode.', 'इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये बालकाण्डे षट्सप्ततितमस्सर्ग:।।', 'Thus ends the seventysixth sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.'

'When Parasurama departed, Rama, son of Dasaratha with a serene mind gave the bow along with the arrow to Varuna of immeasurable strength.   '

'"Parasurama, son of Jamadagni, has gone. Let the four divisions of the army of  which you are the commander proceed towards Ayodhya.'

'The army which is under your command O King is awaiting your orders like the chatakas awaiting water. Direct them (to proceed).'

"On hearing the words 'Parasurama has departed' from Rama, king Dasaratha embraced him and kissed his forehead. The king, immensely happy, felt he and his son were reborn."

'Thereafter, king Dasaratha directed his army to proceed speedily in advance. When he    reached the city of Ayodhya it looked welldecorated with flags and banners. It  resounded with trumpets. The royal highways were sprinkiled with water and strewn with flowers. It was filled with groups of people. Awaiting with delight the arrival of  the king the citizens produced merry sounds with musical instruments.'
