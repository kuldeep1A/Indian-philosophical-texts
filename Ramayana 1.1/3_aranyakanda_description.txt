'The invincible and selfpossessed Rama entered the great forest of Dandaka and saw there a multitude of hermitages of the ascetics.'

'They (the hermitages) were strewn all over with kusa grass and robes by bark with auspicious sacrificial materials around and hence dazzling like the orb of the sun in the sky difficult to gaze.'

'The courtyards (of the hermitages) were cleanswept, sprinkled with water and decorated. They provided shelter to all kinds of creatures and were filled all over with  flocks of birds and antelopes.'

' ', 'The hermitages looked glorified with dances by celestial damsels. They were  adorned with vast fire sanctuaries, ladles for sacrificial ceremonies, deerskins and kusa grass faggots for pots of water, roots and fruits. They looked delightful with huge sacred trees of the forest laden with sweet fruits.'

'The hermitages where various sacrificial offerings were made reverberated with Vedic chantings. Flowers were scattered all over. There was a lotuspond with lotuses. There were aged, selfrestrained sages glowing like the Sun or the fire, living on fruits and roots, clothed in bark and dark  deerskin.'

'The hermitages echoing with  the sounds of Vedic recitations and resembling the very abode of Brahma were adorned with great, holy sages living on regulated diet.'

'The illustrious, effulgent Rama saw groups of hermitages adorned with venerable brahmins, with knowledge of the Supreme Spirit. On seeing them he loosened the string of his great bow and went forward.'

'On seeing Rama with illustrious Sita, the great sages, richly endowed with divine knowledge, went forward to greet him.'

'The sages, steadfast in their vows, saw Rama who was shining like the rising Moon, Lakshmana and the famed Sita went forward and received them with words of benediction.'

'Those sages living  in the forest were wonderstruck to see the handsome, graceful, delicate and welldressed Rama.'

'All the foresters looked at the wonderful figures of Rama, Sita and Lakshmana with unblinking eyes.'

'Ever engaged in the welfare of all beings, the sages made Rama, their guest, sit in their leafy hut.'

'The great sages comparable to the firegod and followers of righteousness honoured Rama  according to tradition by offering water.'

'The sages who were knowers of dharma saluted the noble Rama, offered fruits, roots and flowers available  at the hermitage and with folded palms said thus:'

'O king of great reputation, you are the refuge of the people, a protector of dharma, a chastiser of wrongdoers, a worshipful and respectable preceptor.'

'O Rama, in this world a king is considered the fourth part of Indra as he protects the people. Therefore, he is respected and he enjoys the choicest pleasures of life.'

'Since we are the residents of your territory we deserve to be protected by you. Whether you live in the city or in the forest, you are the lord of the people and our king.'

' ', 'O king, we have conquered our anger and have controlled our senses. We ascetics have cast aside all our authority. We are like your children and need to be protected by you forever'

'Having said so, the ascetics offered with reverence fruits, roots, flowers and other forest  products to Rama and Lakshmana.'

'After receiving hospitality from the sages, Rama took of all of them at sunrise and entered deep into the forest.'

'With Lakshmana following, Rama went through the forest, filled with herds of animals and inhabited by bears and tigers. It was a place where trees, creepers and bushes were crushed (by frequent visits of demons). It was difficult to locate a water source.  And it resounded with the chirping of various birds and insects (crickets).'

'While Rama along with Sita was wandering in the forest infested with  dreadful animals, he saw a roaring cannibal resembling the peak of a mountain.'

' ', 'He was of dreadful appearance with deep eyes, a huge face and a big belly. He looked tall, ugly and frightening.'

'Wearing a tigerskin, he resembled the god of death. With a wide, open mouth, wet with marrow and drenched with blood, he struck terror into  all beings.'

'Roaring loudly, he carried an iron spit in which were pierced three lions, four tigers, two wolves, ten deer  and the huge head of an elephant with its tusks smeared with the fat of flesh.'

'Looking extremely furious, he ran towards Rama, Lakshmana and Sita like the god of death rushes towards the (dying) people.'

'Making a dreadful sound, as if shaking the earth, he took Sita on his lap, stepped aside and said:'

'You both clad in bark and wearing matted hair, holding bows, arrows and swords have entered into the Dandaka forest with your wife. Your life has been cut short indeed৷৷ '

'How is it that you both, dressed in the robes of ascetics, live  with a woman? Leading an unrighteous and sinful life, who are you who have brought disgrace to the ascetic discipline ?'

'I am a demon named Viradha. I move in this dense forest with my weapons eating the flesh of the sages.'

' ', 'This  woman of fine hips shall be my wife. You sinners I shall drink  the blood of both of you in the fight.'

'Sita, daughter of Janaka was bewildered out of fear when she heard the cruel  and boastful words of that wicked Viradha.'

'Seeing the auspicious Sita in the lap of Viradha shaken out of anxiety, like a plantain tree in a strong wind, Rama with his throat parched said to Lakshmana:'

'Gentle Lakshmana, see the illustrious daughter ofJanaka, a lady of good conduct,  brought up in utmost comfort caught in the lap of Viradha'

'O Lakshmana whatever Kaikeyi desired through her boons has now come true so soon.'

'Kaikeyi, my middle mother is farsighted indeed  Not content with the kingdom alone see sent me, beloved of all  beings, away to the forest. Let her cherished desire be fulfilled.'

'O Lakshmana nothing is more sorrowful to me than the touch of Vaidehi by another. It is more painful to me than the death of my father or loss of my kingdom.'

'As Rama was thus full of tears of sorrow, Lakshmana sighed heavily in anger like a hissing serpant in confinement. And said:'

'O Rama, you are, like Indra, lord of all beings. What makes you feel sad like an orphan when I am at your service like a servant?'

'The earth will drink the blood of Viradha with his life gone, slain by my angry arrow.'

'Like Indra who hits the mountain with his thunderbolt, I shall release on Viradha the anger I felt against Bharata for his passion for the kingdom.'

'Spurred by the speed of my strong arms, my arrow will fall on his broad chest and separate his life from his body. Then his body reeling round and round will fall on the ground.', 'इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे द्वितीयस्सर्गः।।', 'Thus ends the second sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki. '

'Graceful Lakshmana asked  Viradha  with a smile, Who are you wandering in the forest at will ?.'

'Then Viradha with his voice filling the forest said, Instead of asking about me you both should speak out who  you are and where you are going'

'Questioned by the demon, who bore a burning countenance, the highly effulgent Rama introduced his Ikshvaku family:'

'Know us to be both kshatriyas, endowed with a good lineage and yet moving in the forest. We both wish to know, who you are and why you are going about in Dandaka forest?'

'Then Viradha said to Rama whose truth was his strength, I will tell you who I am. O, listen:'

'I am indeed son to Jaya. My mother is Satahrada. Verily all the demons on this earth ', 'call me Viradha.'

'By the grace of Lord Brahma I was bestowed with this prowess through my penance. In this world none can kill me with a weapon nor split nor cut me to pieces.'

'Therefore, leave this lady and run away to the place you came from. I will not take away your life .'

'With eyes reddened with anger Rama replied to the sinful, deformed Viradha:'

'O vile, mean creature  surely you are seeking death. Wait, you will meet it in the fight.'

'Then Rama strung his bow immediately, shot the sharp arrows at Viradha and hit him verily.'

' ', 'From his bow  strung tight,  Rama shot seven swift, goldenfeathered arrows comparable to Garuda  and the Windgod in speed.'

'The arrows tied with peacockfeathers, looking like fire, pierced the body of Viradha which, drenched in blood, fell on the ground.'

'Hit  by Rama and Lakshmana, the enraged  demon left Vaidehi, lifted a sharp spear   and ran towards them.'

"The demon who produced a great noise with his wide open mouth resembled the god of death. He lifted a sharp spike that looked like Indra's banner."

'And then both the brothers showered bright arrows on the demon Viradha who looked like Yama, the god of death.'

'The demon who was extremely frightening stood there, laughing and yawning.  As he yawned, all the swiftlyflying arrows fell out of his body.'

'By virtue of a boon Viradha, the demon, controlled the vital breath of his body by a mere touch and, raising the spike, ran towards the two Raghava princes.'

'With two arrows, Rama, the best among wielders of weapons, broke down the spike in the sky burning like fire, and resembling the  thunderbolt of Indra.'

"The spike, broken down by Rama's arrow, fell like a slab of mount Meru splintered by Indra's thunder."

'Then both Rama and Lakshmana quickly raised their swords which looked like black serpents and at once fell upon the demon who was going to strike with great force.'

'Struck down, the angry demon tightly caught hold of both of them under his arms and ', 'wanted to set out, carrying Rama and Lakshmana, the two unshakeable tigers among men. '

'Rama understood the intention of the demon and said to Lakshmana, Let him go his way, no need to stop him.'

'O Lakshmana, let the nightstalker go the way he wishes. That is, in fact, our path.'

'Puffed up with his own great strength, Viradha lifted them and placed them on his shoulders as though they were two children.'

'Then the nightstalker proceeded towards the forest, carrying both the scions of the Raghu race on his shouldersroaring.'

'Seeing those two mightyarmed Rama and Lakshmana being carried away by Viradha, Sita started crying loudly:'



'The wild bears, tigers and panthers will eat me up here. O best among demons, pray take me and leave both the Kakutsthas. '

'On hearing those words of  Sita, both the heroes, Rama and Lakshmana hastened to kill the wicked Viradha.'

'Lakshmana quickly broke the left and Rama the right shoulder of that dreadful demon.'

'With both shoulders broken, the demon, looking like a cloud (huge and dark) fell at once on the ground like a mountain split by a thunderbolt.'

'Striking the demon with fists, knees and feet, both of them smit him  on the bare ground and pulverized him.'

'Although pierced by arrows, and wounded by the two swords, and pulverized on the ground, the demon did not die.'

'Seeing the mountainlike Viradha not dying though seriously wounded, illustrious Rama, guaranter of safety from fear said to Lakshmana:'

'O Lakshmana, best among men, this demon by virtue of his penance cannot be killed with any weapon in war. Therefore, let us bury him.'

' ', 'Dig a deep pit to bury this demon, dreadful like an elephant and emitting a fearful glow.'

"Courageous Rama standing there put his foot firmly on the neck of Viradha and said to Lakshmana,' Dig up a crevice'."

'When the demon Viradha heard Rama saying so, he said these humble words to the scion of the Kakutsthas and the best of men :'

'You have killed me, O Rama, a tiger among men. You are equal to Indra in prowess. O best of men, out of delusion I could not recognise you earlier.'

' ', 'O dear Rama, I know now you are the blessed son of Kausalya, Sita is a noble lady and a glorious soul.'

'I am Tumburu by name,  a celestial singer of the gandharva clan. Cursed by Kubera, I got this dreadful body of a demon.'

'When I appealed to him, that lord of great fame (Kubera) said that I would get back my original form and ascend to heaven when Rama, son of Dasaratha, would kill me in a duel.'

' ', 'When king Kubera saw me absent (from duty) as I was infatuated with Rambha, he got angry and cursed me.'

'O scorcher of enemies by your grace I am rid of the curse. Delivered from my dreadful form, I will now go to my world. May both of you fare well.'

'O dear, there lives Sarabhanga, a righteous sage, comparable to the Sun, at a distance of one and a half yojanas from here. Go to him at once. He will bless you with your wellbeing.'

'Bury me in the pit, O Rama, and proceed happily. This is a great tradition for the dead ', 'demons. Those who are buried in the pit attain heaven.'

'Having said so to Rama, the mighty  Viradha, hit by the arrows left his body and attained heaven.'

'When Rama heard those words, he said, O Lakshmana dig for this elephantlike demon of dreadful acts, a big pit. Having said so the mighty Rama stood firmly stamping the neck of Viradha with his foot.'

'Then Lakshmana fetched a spade and dug a sufficiently big pit by the side of the great soul Viradha.'

"Rama took his foot off Viradha's neck and dropped his body with pointed ears into the pit while Viradha was groaning fearfully৷৷"

'Rama and Lakshmana, stable and firm, brave and quick, together lifted the body of Viradha who was fierce in battle and roaring and forcibly threw it into the pit with joy. '

'The two princes, bulls among men, who were adept in archery saw that the great demon could not be killed by any other means. They reflected over the issue  and undertook the task of killing him with sharp weapons and buried him in a pit.'

'Rama deliberately wanted to kill Viradha with weapons. Viradha the forestranger himself revealed that it was not possible to kill him with weapons and asked Rama to bury him in a pit.'

'While Rama, who had made up his mind after hearing him, was putting the mighty demon in the pit, the forest rang with his roar.'

"Rama and Lakshmana were happy to consign Viradha's body to the pit after killing him. They filled the pit with rocks in the great forest without fear."

'On killing Viradha, the demon of terrific strength, heroic Rama embraced Sita, consoled her and said to his brother Lakshmana, glowing like fire:'

'This wild forest with which we have not been acquainted earlier is difficult  to pass. (Hence) let us proceed quickly to sage Sarabhanga.'

'Rama went to the hermitage of Sarabhanga, a sage with divine grace who had realised the supreme (by his penance). Thus by the side of the sage he witnessed a huge wonder.'

'Rama saw the lord of the gods (Indra) in the sky getting off the chariot, with his body shining brightly like the sun or the fire, followed by the gods, his feet untouched by the earth. Clad in spotless attire and adorned with shining ornaments, he was being worshipped by many greatsouls like him.'

'Not far from that place, Rama saw a chariot, yoked with tawnycoloured horses, shining like the morning  Sun. It looked like a palewhite cloud, resembling the lunar orb.'

"Rama saw a pure white umbrella with a highly expensive golden staff, decorated with variegated flower garlands.While near his (Indra's) head stood a pair of exquisite ladies with fans made of yak's tail."

'Many celestial singers of heaven, gods, great sages and siddhas sang with the choicest words the glory of this god stationed in the sky.'

'While Indra was conversing with Sarabhanga, Rama saw him and said to Lakshmana.'

'Pointing at the chariot, Rama said, Lakshmana, see this wonderful, effulgent chariot endowed with grace is shining like the Sun in the sky.'

'The horses of Indra, who is often invoked (during sacrificial rituals) and about whom  we have heard earlier, are now stationed in the sky.'

'O Lakshmana  around the chariot stand hundreds of finest young men of about twentyfive years. Clad in red robes, they are wearing earrings, and holding swords in their hands. They have broad chests and stout arms like iron beams. Like tigers, they are difficult to overpower. They have necklaces hanging on their chests blazing like fire.'

'These tigers among men have cheerful countenacess from which it can be deduced that the age of the gods always remains constant.'

'Lakshmana, stay here with Sita awhile, until I ascertain who this dazzling being on the chariot is.'

"Instructing Lakshmana to wait , Rama  went towards Sarabhanga's hermitage."

'Then Indra (husband of Sachi) having seen Rama coming towards him, approached Sarabhanga and said this to him privately:'

'Here comes Rama. Before he talks to me, take me to some other place from where he may not be able to see me. He has to do a great task which is difficult for others. I can see him when he accomplishes the taste and emerges victorious.'

'This way honouring the sage Indra, wielder of the thunderbolt, took leave of him and went to heaven in his chariot harressed with horses.'

'When Indra departed like that, Rama with his retinue (Sita and Lakshmana) went to Sarabhanga who was sitting by the side of the firealtar (for Agnihotra).'

' ', "Rama, Sita and Lakshmana prostrated at Sarabhanga's feet. After being permitted to sit, they were invited to stay there."

"Thereafter on Rama's query Sarabhanga told him all about Indra's visit:"

'O Rama, Indra, the bestower of boons, wants to take me to the world of Brahma,  earned by me through severe penance which is most difficult to be attained by those devoid of selfrealisation.'

'O Rama, the best among men you are a very dear guest to me and knowing that you are near, I will not go to the world of Brahman without seeing you.'

'O Rama, the best of men  (only) after seeing a great, virtuous soul like you shall I go to heaven, the abode of the gods.'

'O tiger among men, I have conquered heavenly abodes as well as the imperishable, auspicious worlds of Brahma. Accept them all that are mine (obtained through my penance)'

'To these words of sage Sarabhanga Rama, the best of men, the knower of all sastras, the scion of the Raghus replied:'

'O great sage, I will earn all the worlds myself if you direct me. But I need a proper dwellingplace in this forest.'

'To this request of Rama who was equal to Indra in strength, sagacious Sarabhanga said these words:'

'Here dwells in this forest a brilliant saint, righteous and selfcontrolled, Sutikshna by name who will look to your welfare, O Rama '

'You may approach sage, Sutikshna residing in a sacred spot. He will provide you a delightful place for your stay in the forest.'

'Proceed, O Rama  in the reverse direction of the river Mandakini carrying flowers and floats. And you will reach the place.'

'O Rama, the best among men, this is the way. Look at me for a while, my dear, until I shed my limbs just as a snake sheds its withered slough.'

'Then the effulgent Sarabhanga, knower of mantras (magical spells) kindled the fire with faggots and after offering oblations of ghee plunged in.'

"Then were consumed that highsouled Sarabhanga's hair on the body and on the head, the wornout skin, the bones and flesh along with blood."

'Sarabhanga then emerged youthful from that heap of fire, shining like a flame and looking very elegant৷৷'

'Sarabhanga then went beyond the worlds of the gods, of the great sages who constantly kindle sacrificial fire, and ascended to the world of Brahman.'

'Sarabhanga, performer of sacred deeds, saw Brahma with his followers৷৷ Brahma also seeing Sarabhanga, the best among the brahmins,  welcomed him gladly.', 'इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे पञ्चमः सर्गः।।', 'Thus ends the fifth sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki. '

'When Sarabhanga attained the heaven, all the sages collected together and came to Rama whose radiance was like fire.'

'Vaikhanasas, Valakhilyas, sages who continuously wash their bodies, Marichakas Asmakuttas sages who live on leaves only, those who have teeth like mortar, Unmajjakas, those who use limbs as their bed, those who practise penance without using a bed, those who do penance in the open, unmindful of rain or Sun or wind, those who live on water only, those who penance under the open sky, those who carry on penance on high places like the mountaintop, those who recline on bare ground only, those who observe fast as a part of religious tradition, those selfrestrained men, those who mutter sacred mantras, those who constantly perform penance and those who stand under the blazing Sun in summer placing fire on four sides while performing penanceall these types of sages met Rama in the hermitage of Sarabhanga. '

'All groups of sages, who knew dharma, and were upholders of righteousness reached Rama, the supreme knower of dharma, and said:'

'O great charioteer you are the lord of the Ikshvaku race and of the world just like Indra, chief among the gods.'

'You are renowned in the three worlds for your valour, for your devotion to father, and in you lies enough evidence of your adherence to truth and righteousness.'

'O lord, do excuse us. We sought your help to fulfil our needs since you are at hand. You are a great soul, knower and lover of dharma.'

'O Lord, a king who collect one sixth of the produce as tax and yet does not protect his subjects like his children commits an act of grave injustice. '

'O Rama, whoever protects the inhabitants of his kingdom at all times like his own son who he loves more than his own life will attain the world of Brahma and remain there for long years and will achieve prosperity thereafter.'

'One fourth of the supreme merit a sage earns by living on fruits and roots, accrues to the king through which the people are protected righteously.'

'O Rama  we are a group of great sages, mostly brahmins, leading a vanaprastha  life. Yet with a protector like you, we are slaughtered in large numbers like orphans.'

'Come and see  the bodies of ascetics, who had perceived the Supreme Spirit, killed in large numbers in the forest by the fierce demons.'

'A great slaughter is taking place amongst those residing on the bank of the Pampa lake, near the river Mandakini, and on mount Chitrakuta.'

'We ascetics are not able to tolerate the fearful deeds perpetrated by the dreadful demons in the forest.'

'O Rama, you are worthy of refuge. Hence we have come to you seeking your protection. We are being killed by the nightstalkers. Save us.'

'O great warrior here on this earth there is no protector as mighty as you. So, O prince  save us all from these demons.'

'Having heard this, righteous Rama of the Kakutstha dynasty said to all the ascetics engaged in penance:'

'You should not speak to me this way. I deserve to be commanded by the ascetics. I have not entered this forest only on a personal mission.'

"I came into this forest in obedience to my father's orders to repel the aggression of demons against you."

'I came here to acomplish your task incidentally, Therefore, my stay in the forest will yield great results.'

'I wish to kill in the fight the demons who are your enemies. O great ascetics, you may  witness my prowess supported by my brother. '

'Brave Rama, steadfast in righteousness, worthy of honour, gave assurance to protect the ascetics endowed with the wealth of penance, and proceeded towards sage Sutikshna.', 'इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे षष्ठस्सर्गः।।', 'Thus ends the sixth sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki. '

"Rama, the scorcher of enemies, along with his brother Lakshmana and Sita and the sages went to Sutikshna's hermitage."

'After covering a long distance and crossing the river (Ganga) with plenty of water, Rama saw a huge mountain looking like a lofty cloud.'

'Rama and Lakshmana, the best of the Ikshvaku family, accompanied by Sita entered the dense forest  filled with trees all over.'

'Entering that dreadful forest, they saw trees full of flowers and fruits, and a hermitage in a lonely place with lines of bark robes hanging.'

'There at the hermitage was Sutikshna, an ascetic grown old with (long) penance, wearing soiled, matted locks and seated. Rama (first) addressed him as per custom.'

'O venerable one, I am Rama.You are a great sage, armed with truth as your prowess and a knower of dharma. I have come to see you. Could you speak to me?'

'Thereafter the composed Sutikshna, looked at Rama, the best among righteous men, and embracing him with both his arms said:'

'O Rama, the best among the Raghavas and among the upholders of truth, you are welcome. With your presence this hermitage will have a protector now.'

'O renowned hero, I had heard that you have come to Chitrakuta, renouncing your  ', 'kingdom. I have been waiting so long to see you here. Unable to give up this body, I did not even leave the earth for heaven, the world of the gods.'

'O scion of the Kakutstha family, Indra, king of the gods came to me and said that by my meritorious deeds I have won all the worlds.'

'Along with your wife and Lakshmana you may roam by my grace the worlds won by me and served by divine sages like devarsi Narada.'

'Selfpossessed Rama replied to the truthful ascetic who had performed intense penance. Just as Kasyapa would address Lord Brahma:'

'O great sage I will win all the worlds myself. I (only) want to live in this forest. Allow me. '

"You are ever engaged in the welfare of all beings. I have heard this from the great sage Sarabhanga of Gautama's clan."

'Thus addressed by  Rama, Sutikshna, the great sage, wellknown to the world was highly delighted. He (then) said these sweet words:'

'O Rama this is a salubrious hermitage where hosts of sages live and which is full of roots and fruits, you may enjoy yourself here.'

'O illustrious Rama, herds of animals visit this place fearlessly, enticing the inmates and (then) go back without harming any one.'

'When heroic Rama heard that there was no other problem from the wild animals except their frequent incursions, he lifted his bow with an arrow and said these words:'

'O reverend one, I will kill with a sharpedged arrow, glowing like a thunderbolt, all those herds of animals who keep coming here.'

'What can be more agonizing for you (than my killing animals). I (therefore) do not foresee our long stay in this hermitage.'

'Rama stopped with this. And then the evening drew to a close. Offering his evening oblation, he arranged for his stay along with Sita and Lakshmana in the delightful hermitage of Sutikshna.'

'Rama stopped with this. And then the evening drew to a close. Offering his evening oblation, he arranged for his stay along with Sita and Lakshmana in the delightful hermitage of Sutikshna.'

'Seeing that the evening had passed and night had set in, the great sage Sutikshna with due hospitality, served those best of men, food fit for ascetics.', 'इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे सप्तमस्सर्गः।।', 'Thus ends the seventh sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki. '

'Rama, worshipped by Sutikshna and accompanied by Lakshmana, spent the night at the hermitage, and got up early in the morning.'

'In the morning Rama and Sita got up in time and took bath in cool, lilyfragrant water.'

'And as per routine, sinless Sita, Rama and Lakshmana offered prayers to the fire and other gods of the forest which was the refuge of the ascetics. Seeing the rising Sun, they worshipped him, and approaching Sutikshna,  said these soothing words:'

'O revered Sutikshna received by one so worshipworthy like you, we spent the night well. We (now)take leave of you. The sages  are hastening us.'

'We wish to see the entire circle of hermitages of the sages, residing in Dandaka forest. So we are in a hurry. '

'We seek your permission to go with the great sages, who are ever engaged in righteousness, selfcontrolled by virtue of their penance, and are like flameless fire.'

'We wish to depart before the Sun grows unbearably hot like the man devoid of good lineage who acquires wealth through unlawful means (becomes arrogant). Thereafter Rama along with Sita and Lakshmana offered worship at the feet of the venerable sage.'

'When both Rama and Lakshmana touched the feet of Sutikshna, the best of the sages, he lifted them up, hugged them tightly, and said affectionately:'

'You may safely tread, O Rama, this path along with Lakshmana and Sita who is following you like a shadow. '

'O valient Rama the sages, living in  the Dandaka forest, are self realised souls. See how delightful is the location of their hermitages.'

'You will see the beautiful forestareas with abundant fruits and roots, flowers in full bloom, herds of animals, flocks of quiet birds tanks and lakes filled  with clean waters and shining with fully blossomed lotuses, resounding with waterducks and peacocks  and waterfalls coming down the hills. Thus you will enjoy a delightful sylvan sight.'

'O dear Rama, O Lakshmana you may leave (now), you may have to come back to this hermitage after seeing those places.'

'Thus addressed, Rama, scion of the Kakutsthas along with Lakshmana circumambulated the sage (in reverence) and set forth.'

'Thereafter largeeyed Sita handed the brothers two quivers, two bows as well as two excellent swords.'

'Both Rama and Lakshmana  tied their auspicious quivers, took the two twanging bows and departed from the hermitage.'

'Handsome Rama and Lakshmana, glowing in their radiance held the bows and exited  with Sita.', 'इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे अष्टमस्सर्गः।।', 'Thus ends the eighth sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic ', 'composed by sage Valmiki.'

'While Rama was leaving with the permission of Sutikshna, Sita spoke these warm, affectionate words to her husband:'

'This great path of dharma you are following now can be attained only through subtle means by one free from addiction born of passion.'

"There are three kinds of vices born out of lust. First, speaking untruth, second, having sexual relation with others' wives and third, resorting to violence with no enmity. The later two vices are of serious nature."

"O Rama you never spoke untruth in the past nor will you speak in future. How can there be any desire in you to destroy the virtue of others' wives ?"

"O Rama, lord among men, you hadn't it (lust for other women) in the past. You havn't it now. Never does it exist even in your mind."

' ', "O prince, you are always faithful to your wife. You are righteous, truthful and obedient to your father's orders."

'O Rama, you are truthful, honourable, powerful. O elder brother of Lakshmana, in you is established truth and righteousness.'

'O longarmed one, to contain all this is only possible for those who have conquered the senses. O handsome one, I know your ability to control the senses.'

'(But) you are a victim to the third (vice born of lust) i.e. showing violence without cause for enmity'

'O valiant one, you have promised to kill the demons in the battle, in order to protect the sages residing in the Dandaka forest.'

'It is only on account of this that you entered the wellknown Dandaka forest with your brother wielding bow and arrows.'

'I am, therefore, worried in my mind when I see you here and think of your wellbeing. I wish your ultimate good. 

'O brave Rama, I do not like your going to Dandaka forest. I shall tell you the reason. Do listen.'

'Of course, you will go to the forest with your brother, holding the bow and arrows. Release the arrows when you see the forestrangers.'

'A bow in the hand of a kshatriya is like fuel to fire. It surely swells his strength and his brilliance.'

'O mightyarmed one, there dwelt in the past an ascetic, noble and truthful in a sacred forest where animals and birds lived merrily together.'

'Once Indra, husband of Sachi, came to his hermitage in the guise of an attendant, sword in hand, in order to hinder his penance.'

'Then while the sage was practising penance at the hermitage, he gave him that excellent sword to be kept in trust.'

'Having received the weapon as a trust, the sage went wandering in the forest, always attentive in safeguarding the weapon.'

'Vigilant about protecting the sword deposited with him, the sage never moved without it even when he went gathering roots and fruits.'

'While the sage moved about holding the weapon, he gave up the practice of penance gradually and developed a violent mindset.'

'By association with the sword, he developed a violent attitude. And in that habitual state of excitement he was dragged into unrighteous ways which (ultimately) took him to hell.'

'Contact with the weapon has led to this in the past. Like contact with fire, it leads man to destruction. I say this out of my love and reverence for you as a reminder and not as an instruction.'

'While holding a bow, you should not have the intention to kill demons residing in Dandaka with no animosity against you. O valiant one  I do not desire that any one should be killed without incurring any offence.'

'It is the duty of a kshatriya, a warrior to protect with his bow those who practise selfcontrol (penance) in the forest in a state of panic.'

' ', 'Where is the question of wielding a weapon and living in the forest, where is the life of a kshatriya and the life of penance? For us, this is an encroachment. Let the law of the land be honoured.'

'Lord, when we handle the weapon, the mind gets vitiated. (Only) after returning to Ayodhya can you perform the duty of a kshatriya.'

'You would have been on unlimited source of joy to my fatherinlaw and motherinlaw had you permanently renounced the kingdom for the life of an ascetic.'

'Righteousness brings wealth. Wealth brings happiness. Righteousness brings everything. In fact, the essence of the world is righteousness.'

'The wise earn dharma through getting their bodies emaciated by carefully adopting ', 'different means of discipline (selftorture). Happiness does not beget happiness.'

'O gentle one you may move in this forest of ascetics with a pure mind. The true meaning behind everything in these three worlds is known to you, indeed.'

'Having heard these words spoken by Sita who was devoted to her husband, replied Rama who was firm in righteousness.'

'O daughter of Janaka, you are conversant with dharma. Whatever you have admonished out of affection for me is befitting your race.'

'But permit me, Devi, you have already stated, when a kshatriya holds a bow there will be no cry of distress. (it means you approve of my holding a bow)'

'O Sita, the sages who perform rigorous penance in Dandaka forest came to me personally, seeking shelter although they can be their own protection.'

'The sages living in the forest, eating roots and fruits and ever engaged in righteous activities are afraid of the depredations of the demons, with their happiness gone.'

'The sages engrossed in various austerities in the forest have been victims to the dreadful demons living on human flesh.'

'The ascetics, the best of brahmins living in Dandaka forest being eaten up like that besought me to come to their rescue.'

'On hearing the words that came from their mouth, I bowed at their feet and said:'

'Be pleased  That brahmins like you have approached me while I should have come to you has put me to shame immeasurable .'

'I enquired about what I could do for them. And all the brahmins in one voice said:.'

"'O Rama, the demons who can assume any form at their will are mercilessly tormenting us in Dandaka forest. Do protect us from them'."

"'O sinless one, these cannibals are invincible. They arrive at the time of our sacrificial rituals, on the days of festivities or at the time of lunar conjunctions like no moon or full moon days and attack us."

"'You are the supreme refuge for us ascetics, tormented by demons, helpless men in search of shelter."



"'O Rama it is difficult to perform penance which is ever full of obstacles. Therefore, we do not pronounce curses even if eaten up by demons'."

' ', "'The demons, dwelling in the Dandaka forest are tormenting us. You alone are our lord in the forest. Do protect us with your brother.'"

'O daughter of Janaka, on hearing the words of the sages I promised to undertake the entire protection of sages of the Dandaka forest.'

'Having promised the sages, I cannot do otherwise as long as I have life in me. To me truth is always dear.'

' ', 'O Sita I may forfeit my life forsake, even Lakshmana and you but will not break the promise made specially to the brahmins৷৷'

'Even before the sages requested me I should have protected them. What to speak of the promise I have already made ?'

'O sinless one all that has been said by you is out of your love and affection for me. I am pleased. What is harmful is never advised.'

'Your auspicious words are quite befitting your lineage. You are the follower of my dharma and so dearer to me than my life.'

'Having said this to Sita, the princess of Mithila, Rama along with Lakshmana, bow in hand, moved about the delightful penancegrove.', 'इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे दशमस्सर्गः।।', 'Thus ends the tenth sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by the sage Valmiki.'

'Rama walked in front, Sita with a beautiful waist, in the middle and Lakshmana holding the bow, behind them৷৷'

'Both Rama and Lakshmana walked on, accompanied by Sita, watching several beautiful mountain ranges, forests  and rivers.'

' ', '(Watching) the swans and ruddy geese on river banks and lakes full of lotuses, and birds on water and in the sky.'

' ', '(Watching) herds of deer, intoxicated horned buffaloes, wild boars and elephants who are enemies of trees (elephants uproof trees).'

'As the Sun was setting, they had covered a long distance, watching a yojanalong tank adorned with lotuses, and crowded with herds of elephants and flocks of cranes, swans and aquatic animals.'

'In that lake of clear waters they heard the sounds of songs and musical instruments, while there were none around.'

'Out of curiosity, mighty Rama, and Lakshmana started enquiring about the matter from sage Dharmabrata by name:'

'O great sage, this very wonderful sound, has whetted our great curiosity. If there is no top secret about this, do disclose it.'

'Thus addressed by Rama, the righteous sage narrated the entire origin of the lake. '

'O Rama this lake called Panchapsara  filled with water at all times has been created through penance by a sage called Mandakarni.'

'Great sage Mandakarni standing in water and living on air performed  rigorous penance for ten thousand years.'

'Thereafter very much perturbed, all the gods led by Agni gathered together at one place and started deliberating among themselves.'

' ', "'The gods of heaven became agitated in their minds thinking the sage might usurp one of their places."

'All the gods then engaged five of the important nymphs, glittering like lightning, to disturb the penance of the sage.'

'The sage, a knower of the inner self and the world of plurality, was gripped by passion for the apsaras, who had come to achieve the target of the gods.'

'The five apsaras, got the status of wives to the sage who built them an invisible home inside the lake.'

'The apsaras lived happily with the sage who remained youthful by virtue of his penance.'

'While the apsaras played their musical instruments, their melodious songs mingled ', 'with the sounds of ornaments are heard.'

"Glorious Rama and his brother heard the wonderful words of the selfrealised sage and exclaimed, 'How strange '"

'When the sage Dharmabrata was telling the story, Rama saw a hermitage strewn all over with kusa grass and bark garments, and endowed with pure brahminic grace.'

'Illustrious Rama accompanied by Vaidehi and Lakshmana entered the hermitage and, honoured by all the sages, stayed there.'

'Rama, the scion of the Kakutstha race, wielder of great weapons, stayed in that beautiful hermitage, accepting the hospitality of the sages extended with due honour, He visited in turn their penancegroves where he repeated his stay.'

'Rama lived happily here for about ten months, there one year, here four or five or six months and there over one or half a month or three or eight months in another.'

'Thus enjoying their stay in the hermitages, Rama, Sita and Lakshmana spent ten favourable years.'

"Rama went round who was full of grace and full of knowledge on dharma went round with Sita and came back to Suthikshna's hermitage."

'On his arrival, Rama, the subduer of enemies, was honoured by the sages at the hermitage where he stayed for a short time.'

'Once while sitting beside sage Sutikshna at the hermitage Rama humbly addressed him:'

'I have heard others saying that lord Agastya, the great sage, lives in this forest. '

'I am unable to locate the sacred hermitage of that sagacious sage due to the vastness of this forest.'

' ', 'By your grace, I wish to go there with Sita and my brother Lakshmana to offer our respectful salutations.'

'There is a great desire  in my heart to serve in person the best of sages, Agastya.'

'Hearing the words of Rama, the righteous son of Dasaratha, sage Sutikshna was pleased to reply:'

'I also wished you, O Raghava, to visit Agastya along with Sita and Lakshmana.'

'Luckily you have asked me on your own. I will tell you where the great sage Agastya lives.'

"Dear Rama, walk from here a distance of four yojanas. There in the southerly direction  stands the great, beautiful hermitage of Agastya's brother."

'This plain land in the beautiful forest tract is adorned with fig trees,filled with  flowers, fruits, and delightful sounds of different birds.'

'O Rama, there are lotusponds filled with clear, sacred waters, with different kinds of swans, ducks and ruddy geese. Spend one night there and proceed early in the morning.'

' ', "If you go in the southern direction for a yojana you will find Agasthya's hermitage by the side of a cluster of trees."

'Vaidehi will feel happy in your company in that delightful forest region full of many trees.So too will Lakshmana.'

'O glorious one, if you have made up your mind to visit that great sage Agastya, think of starting today itself.'

'Rama heard the words of the sage, offered him reverential salutations and set out along with his brother and Sita.'

'Enjoying the sight of delightful forests, cloudlike mountains, lakes and rivers on the  way, and following the directions given by  Sutikshna, Rama was happy. He said  to Lakshmana:'

"Surely this is the hermitage of great Agastya's brother, a man of holy deeds."

' ', 'This is the glade we were told about with thousands of trees drooping down with abundant fruits and flowers.'

'Feel this sudden astringent smell of ripe figs wafted by the breeze from the forest.'

'Heaps of firewood are seen here and there on the path. There are blades of grass (used for sacrificial ceremonies) shining like vaidurya (gems).'

'In the middle of the forest can be seen like the tip of the dark clouds columns of smoke coming out of the top of hermitages. '

'Priests are coming out of the solitary sacred spots after their bath and making offerings of flowers they had themselves plucked.'

"O handsome one, surely this is the hermitage of Agastya's brother about which I heard from Sutikshna."



'Assuming the form of a brahmin and using Sanskrit language, Ilvala would invite brahmins for offering shraddha to the dead  '

'Ilvala would keep his brother sanctified, so that he is fit for offering, Then he would feed the brahmins with mutton according to the rituals.'

"Then when the brahmins finished eating, Ilvala would call aloud, 'O Vatapi come out'."

"Then hearing his brother's voice, Vatapi would bleat like a sheep and jump out, tearing open the bodies of those brahmins."

'In this manner, thousands of brahmins used to be killed daily by those carnivorous demons who assumed any form at their free will.'

'Urged by the gods, Agastya  came  for the shradda . The mighty demon played the same routine trick and Vatapi, for sure, was eaten by the great sage.'

'Saying, the ritual is complete Ilvala offered water in the palm of Agastya and called his brother to come out.'

'Wise Agastya,  the best among the ascetics, laughing aloud, said to Ilvala, the destroyer of brahmins:'

'I have digested the demon Vatapi your brother, who assumed the form of a sheep. He has reached the abode of Yama, Lord of death. Where does he have the power to come out?'

'On hearing the news of the death of his brother, the demon Ilvala, out of anger, started attacking the sage.'

'Ilvala who pounced upon Agastya, the best among the sages whose lustre lay consumed by the fire of his eyes which were in flames.'

'This hermitage surrounded by beautiful lakes and forests belongs to his brother (Sudarsana). Out of sympathy for Agastya, he has accomplished this difficult task.'

'While Rama was thus narrating to Lakshmana (the story of Agastya), the Sun set and evening closed in.'

'Rama with his brother Lakshmana duly offered oblations at twilight, entered the hermitage and greeted the sage (Sudarsana) with folded palms.'

'Warmly received by the sage, Rama shared the roots and fruits and slept the night there.'

'When the night passed and the Sun became bright, Rama took leave of the brother of Agastya.'

'O Lord, the night has been wellspent. Now we humbly seek leave of you to see your respectable elder brother.'

'With his permission, Rama, the delight of the Raghu race, proceeded along the path indicated, watching (the beauty of) the forest.'

'They passed by wild rice fields, jackfruit trees, palmyra and various other trees like Ashoka, trees with white flowers, old trees that existed for a long time, mahva trees, bilva trees and tindukas.'

'Rama saw hundreds of trees crushed by the trunks of elephants and by monkeys. He saw some trees echoing with notes of hundreds of intoxicated birds. He saw tree tops coiled with creepers in full bloom.'

'Then the lotuseyed Rama said to the chivalrous, graceful Lakshmana who stood behind him:'

'The leaves of the trees here are glossy, the animals and birds are peaceful. It appears the hermitage of the selfrealized great sage Agastya is not very far from here.'

'Here is the hermitage of Agastya, wellknown in the world for his deeds a place of rest for those tired with hard work.'

'This forest is enveloped with the smoke rising from the sacrificial altar. There are rows of bark robes hanging. Herds of quiet animals lying and different kind of birds chirping around.'

"This is his hermitage. On account of his (Agastya's) impact the demons look south but cannot eat the hermits out of fear (for the sage)."

'Since the time Agastya of sacred deeds occupied this direction the demons are quiet, leaving all enmity.'

'The southern side favourable to the people was famous by the name Agastya in the three worlds and stood unassailable to the demons.'

"This is the hermitage of the longlived Agastya who is renowned for his deeds and is served by humble people. The great mountain Vindhya that was growing incessantly and obstructing the path of the Sun stopped growing any more in obedience to Agastya's words."

'We are going to join this sage honoured by the people of the world and ever engaged in the welfare of the virtuous. This augurs well for us.'

'O noble, handsome Lakshmana, I will spend the rest of the exile in this forest in the worship of the great sage Agastya.'

'The gods along with gandharvas, siddhas and great sages always serve Agastya, observing discipine in their food habits.'

'This sage is such type that he (his spiritual power) will not allow a liar or a cruel man or a deceitful or lustful  or wicked person to thrive here.'

'Here gods, yakshas, nagas and birds live, following the righteous path and observing discipline in food habits.'

'Here great souls like sages and siddhas gave up the ghost and with renewed bodies left for heaven on aerochariot resembling the Sun (in brightness).'

'Worshipped by benevolent beings, the gods here bestow on them the status of demigods or of the immortals or several kinds of kingdoms.'

' ', 'Lakshmana, the younger brother of Rama,  entered the hermitage of Agastya and met one of his disciples and said to him these words :'

' ', 'The valiant eldest son of  king Dasaratha has come along with his wife Sita to see the sage.'

' ', 'I am his younger brother Lakshmana, his wellwisher and faithful devotee if you have at all heard about me.'

' ', 'By the command of our father, we have entered this dense forest and desire to see the   divine sire. Please report.'

"\nThe ascetic heard Lakshmana, and saying, 'let it be so', entered the firesanctuary to report."

' ', "Having promptly entered, Agastya's favourite disciple with folded hands reported as he was told by Lakshmana about Rama's arrival to the great sage who was armed with the inviolable powers of penance :"

' ', 'Rama and Lakshmana, the two sons of Dasaratha along with Sita, wife of Rama, have arrived at the hermitage.'

' ', 'Both the subduers of enemies  have come here now to see and serve your Holiness. You may order what is to be done next.'

' ', 'Having heard from the disciple about the arrival of Rama, Lakshmana and great daughter of the king of Videha the sage said :'

' ', 'It is good fortune that Rama has come here after a long time to see me. I was longing for his arrival.'

' ', 'Go quickly and with due hospitality conduct Rama, his wife Sita and brother Lakshmana into my presence. Why was he not ushered in so long?'

' ', "'So be it ' said the disciple respectfully with folded palms in response to what the ", 'great sage, knower of dharma, commanded.'

' ', "Then the disciple in a state of excitement came out of the hermitage and said to Lakshmana, 'Where is Rama? Let him come himself to see the sage'."

' ', 'Then Lakshmana reached the entrance of the hermitage with the disciple  and showed  Rama of the Kakutstha race and Sita, daughter of Janaka .'

' ', "The disciple humbly reported Agastya's words and ushered him in with befitting hospitality."

' ', 'Then Rama, Sita and Lakshmana entered the hermitage, watching herds of quietly moving deer (undisturbed by their entry).'

' ', 'Rama saw at the hermitage, the places (altars) of Brahma, Visnu, Agni (firegod), Indra, Sun, Moon, Bhaga, Kubera, Dhata (supreme spirit), Vidhata (creator Brahman), Vayu (Windgod), Ananta (great serpentking),  Gayatri, Vasu Pasahasta, Varuna, Kartikeya and Dharma .'

'\nRama saw at the hermitage, the places (altars) of Brahma, Visnu, Agni (firegod), Indra, Sun, Moon, Bhaga, Kubera, Dhata (supreme spirit), Vidhata (creator Brahman), Vayu (Windgod), Ananta (great serpentking), Gayatri, Vasu Pasahasta, Varuna, Kartikeya and Dharma .'

'Thereafter surrounded by the disciples the sage came out. Rama saw him coming in front of the effulgent sages.'

' ', 'The valiant Rama said to Lakshmana, the enhancer of prosperity, O Lakshmana, sage Agastya is coming out. By virtue of his noble appearance, I know this sage to be a great treasuretrove of penances.'

' ', 'Having said so, the mightyarmed Rama, the scorcher of enemies, grasped the feet of Agastya who was shining like the Sun.'

' ', 'Then righteous Rama with Sita, the princess of Videha, and Lakshmana offered respects with folded palmsstanding.'

' ', 'Agastya received Rama by offering him seat and water, enquired about his wellbeing  and said: Please be seated,'

' ', 'After giving oblations to the fire, and  providing respectful offerings, the sage worshipped the guests according to the tradition of hermits and served them food. '

' ', 'And then the great sage Agastya, knower of dharma  first took his seat and addressed Rama, an export in the knowledge of dharma, seated with folded palms.'

' ', 'O scion of the Kakutstha dynasty, only  after offering oblations to the Firegod, a guest should be worshipped with water etc. Otherwise the host will have to eat his own flesh in the other world like a false witness.'

' ', 'You are king of all the worlds, a follower of dharma, a great warrior worthy of worship and an esteemed self. O Rama you are such a dear guest come to me.'

' ', 'Having said this to Rama, (the sage) honoured him by offering fruits, roots, flowers and other things as desired. He then said to Rama once again:'

' ', 'O best among men  this divine bow studded with gold and gems  belongs to Visnu and designed by Visvakarma. This excellent, unfailing arrow, bright like the Sun, was given to me by Brahma.'

'These two quivers filled fully with sharp inexhaustible arrows, shining like flames of fire and this sword adorned with gold and this big silver sheath were given to me by Indra. '

' ', 'In ancient times Visnu killed the demons in a battle with this bow and brought back the glittering prosperity for the gods.'

' ', 'O bestower of honour, receive this bow, the two quivers, the sword and the arrow for your victory just like Indra accepts the thunderbolt.'

'The luminous lord Agastya, having said this, gave all the excellent weapons to Rama. And continued :   ', 'इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे द्वादशस्सर्गः।।', 'Thus ends the twelfth sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.'

' ', 'O Rama ,I am pleased. I wish you well. I am glad that both of you have come here with Sita to pay respect to me.'

' ', 'Both of you are tired due to the journey. It is evident that Sita, daughter of Janaka, is anxious (to rest).'

' ', 'Even though delicate, Sita never feels discouraged by difficulties. She has come to the forest full of obstacles, since she is motivated by her love for her husband.'

'O Rama, help Sita enjoy herself in whatever manner she likes. By following you into the forest, she has accomplished the most difficult task৷৷'

' ', 'O Rama, the delight of the Raghu dynasty from the beginning of the creation women, by nature,  keep the husband company when all goes well and give them up when hard times come.'

' ', 'Women are fickle like lightning, sharp like weapons and fast like Garuda or the ', 'windgod.'

' ', 'Your wife is free from such blemishes. She is praiseworthy and worthy of mention as an example just like the revered Arundhati.'

'O Rama, subduer of enemies the place where you reside along with Lakshmana and Vaidehi will look adorned, indeed.'

' ', 'Thus addressed, Rama held his palms together and said politely to the sage shining like fire:'

' ', 'I consider myself blessed and favoured by a great sage like you, bestower of boons as you have been pleased with me, my brother and my life.'

' ', 'Direct me to a place with water and dense forest where we can build an ashram and live happily.'

' ', 'On hearing the words of Rama, Agastya, the best among the sages, coolheaded and righteous, thought a while and uttered these words coolly :'

' ', 'O dear two yojanas away is a place wellknown as Panchavati, a beautiful resort with many roots, fruits, plenty of water and many animals.'

' ', 'Reaching there, you wikk build a hermitage with Lakshmana and enjoy your life given to the fulfilment of the pledge to the father.'

' ', 'O Rama, scion of the Kakutsthas  much of the period of exile king Dasaratha had assigned has passed. You will fulfil your promise and live happily in the kingdom.'

' ', 'O Rama, joy of the Raghu family with the eldest son like you, your father is blessed and liberated like king Yayati.'

' ', 'O sinless one, I have kown all these facts about you by the power of penance and love for Dasaratha.'

' ', 'I know your heart by virtue of my penance. I, therefore, ask you to proceed to Panchavati, after ensuring your stay here with me in this penancegrove for the time being.'

' ', 'O Raghava, that forest tract is delightful and beautiful. It is not far away(from here). Maithili (Sita) will enjoy her stay there.'

'O longarmed Rama,that place has plenty of roots and fruits. It is a solitary, holy and beautiful place teeming with various kinds of birds. Sita will enjoy her stay in the vicinity of river Godavari.'

' ', 'O Rama, while staying with your wife, you will look after the ascetics living there since ', 'you are capable of giving protection. '

' ', 'O valiant Rama look at the great forest of madhuka trees. Walk north to the forest till you see a great banyan tree.'

' ', 'Then climb the elevated ground not very far from the mountain. There is the wellknown Panchavati with forests, ever in full bloom.'

' ', 'Thus addressed by Agastya,  Rama with Lakshmana paid respects to the sage wedded to truth and took leave of him.'

' ', 'Both of them worshipped the feet of sage Agastya, and proceeded to Panchavati with his permission.'

' ', 'Both the princes, unafraid of battles, held their bows, tied the quivers and carefully proceeded towards Panchavati along the path suggested by the sage.', 'इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे त्रयोदशस्सर्गः।।', 'Thus ends the thirteenth sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.'

'On the way to Panchavati, Rama, the delight of the Raghu race, met a vulture with a huge body and fearful strength.'

'Seeing the bird on the banyan tree, venerable Rama and Lakshmana mistook him for a demon and enquired who he was.'

'With a sweet, pleasing, and gentle voice he said to both of them, O dear know me to be a friend of your father.'

'Rama knew he was a friend of his father. So he enquired in a cool, composed voice his name and his lineage.'

"On hearing Rama's words, the bird started narrating the origin of all beings including his own family:"

'O mightyarmed Rama hear from me while I am telling you about the lords of ', 'creation from the very beginning.'

'O Rama among the lords of all beings the first was Kardama, the next was Vikritha, followed by Sesha, Samsrya Bahuputra, Sthanu, Mareechi, Atri and mighty Kratu, Pulastya, Angirasa, Pracheta, similarly Pulaha and Daksha.Following them were Vivasvan, Arishtanemi and the very glorious Kasyapa who was the last ruler.'

'O glorious Rama it is wellknown that Daksha, the creator had sixty daughters of great fame.'

'Out of them(daughters of Daksha) Kasyapa married eight women of beautiful waist called Aditi, Diti, Danu also Kalika,Tamra, Krodhavasa, Anala and Manu.'

' ', 'Kasyapa, pleased with them said to his young wives, Beget sons of my stature who can rule over the three worlds.'

'O best of men, O longarmed Rama while Aditi, Diti and Kalika seriously considered his advice, the rest of the wives did not.'

'O Rama, subduer and scorcher of enemies to Aditi were born twelve Adityas, eight Vasus, eleven Rudras, and two Asvins, thirtythree deities in all.'

'O dear Rama, Diti bore glorious sons called Daityas and this earth with all the forests and seas belonged to them.'

'O subduer of enemies, to Danu was born Hayagriva and to Kalika, Naraka and Kalaka.'

'To Tamra were born, Krounchi, Bhasi, Syeni, Dhrutharashtri and Suki. Altogether they were five beautiful young maids famous in the world.'

'Krounchi gave birth to owls, Bhasi to Bhasa birds, Synei to bright hawks and vultures, Dhrutharashtri to swans and chakravakas with sweet notes.'

'Dhrutharashtri, a female bird of great lustre gave birth to chakravakas too. Suki gave birth to Nata and from Nata, Vinata was born. Be blessed, O Rama'

'O Ramato Krodhavasa were born Mrugi, Mrugamanda, Hari, Bhadramada, Mathangi, Sardooli, Sweta, Surabhi and Surasa, Kadruva and endowed with all virtues.'

'O Rama, bull among men Manu procreated brahmins, kshatriyas, vaisyas and sudras all famed human beings.'

'Anala (wife of Kasyapa) procreated trees with sacred fruits. Vinata was the granddaughter of Suki, and Kahdruva and Surasa were her sisters.'

'Kadhru produced a thousandhooded serpent(Adisesha) who held the whole earth on his head and Vinata, two sons, Garuda and Aruna.'

'I am born to Aruna and my elder brother is Sampati. O subduer of enemies, know me as Jatayu, son of Syeni.'

'If you so desire I will be helpful to you in guarding your hut. O dear, it is a difficult forest full of wild animals and demons. When you and Lakshmana are away I will protect Sita.'

"Rama worshipped  Jatayu and bending down, embraced him. He heard from him again and again several events relating to Jatayu's  friendship with his father."

'Entresting the protection of Sita, the princess of Mithila, to that strong vulture,  Jatayu, and accompanied by Lakshmana Rama went to Panchavati wishing to destroy the enemies like fire burning the moths.', 'इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामयणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे चतुर्दशस्सर्गः।।', 'Thus ends the fourteenth sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.'

'On reaching Panchavati, which was full of various vicious animals, Rama said to Lakshmana, his brother who was glowing like  fire:'

'O handsome one, following the directions of the great sage, we have arrived at Panchavati, a place full of blossoming trees.'

'O Lakshmana cast your eyes all around the forest for a suitable place (for building a hermitage).  Indeed, you are good at judging things.'

'Look, O Lakshmana  for a place to the liking of Sita, a place where there is water source nearby  where both of us can enjoy. Find a beautiful location where the surrounding forest is beautiful and where faggots, flowers, water and kusa grass are available at hand.'

'Having been thus instructed by Rama, Lakshmana said with folded palms in the presence of Sita:'

'O Rama, I shall be dependent on you, even if I live for a hundred years. You only need to indicate a beautiful place of your choice. '

' ', 'Rama was pleased with the words of great Lakshmana. Deliberating over it, he agreed upon a site suitable in all respects.'

'Having come to a beautiful spot suitable for the asram, Rama took both the hands of  Lakshmana in his own and said:'

'This place is level, surrounded by beautiful trees in full bloom. O handsome one, you may build the hermitage here.'

'There, not very far, is a beautiful lotustank shining like the Sun, fragrant with lotuses.'

'As said by the selfrealised soul, sage Agastya, this Godavari is beautiful, surrounded by trees with flowers in bloom, filled with flocks of swans, ducks and ruddy geese.'

'O handsome one, neither far nor near are seen tall mountains and flowering trees and herds of deer. Their numerous caves echo with sounds of peacocks.'

'These mountains, with streaks of minerals like gold, silver and copper forming decorative designs, look beautiful like colourful windows, and appear like huge elephants.'

'The place is covered with  sal and palmyrah trees including mango, jackfruit, dates, kadamba, punnaga, ashoka, champak, tilaka, ketaka, sandalwood, spandan, dhava, asvakarna parnasha, khadira, sami, kimsuka and patala trees. It is full of wild paddy, flowering bushes and creepers that run on the ground.'

'This is a holy place fit for sacrifice. There are many animals and birds here.Hence we will reside here with Jatayu.'

'Thus directed by Rama, the mighty Lakshmana, destroyer  of enemy warriors, soon built a hermitage for his brother.'

'Lakshmana who was quick to act dug the clay with nippers, planted long bamboo poles, put branches of sami trees across and tied them with strong ropes. He spread kusa and kasa grass and leaves on the levelled ground. He built a beautiful, spacious and nice residence for Rama.'

'Lakshmana then went to river Godavari, had his bath, and returned with some lotuses.'

'Lakshmana offered oblation of flowers, invoked peace as per tradition (before occupying a newly made home) and showed Rama the cottage he had built.'

'Rama and Sita saw the beautiful hermitage built by Lakshmana, and expressed much happiness over the leafthatched cottage. '

'Deeply pleased with Lakshmana, he hugged him tightly and said those loving words :'

' ', 'O my master, you have done a great task for which I have given you what I could give at the moment a hug.'

"O Lakshmana with a son like you who can understand others' feelings, who has a sense of gratitude and a sense of duty my father is not dead yet."

'Rama who was an enhancer of fortunes and who had his senses under control said thus to Lakshmana and lived happily there in that place filled with fruits.'

'While valiant Lakshmana, walking behind Sita who was carrying a pitcher in her hand bent down a little and told Rama thus:'

'O sweetspeaking brother, the season which is dear to you has arrived. It appears the auspicious year is going to be embellished with this season.'

'People feel frozen with fog, and water is no more enjoyable. The earth is full of crops and fire is so agreeable.'

'Pious men offer their libations of the first crop at Agnistoma sacrifice and thereby please their manes and get rid of their sins. '

"People in the countryside with their desires satisfied obtain abundant cow's milk at this time. Rulers of the earth are out on their expedition with a desire for victory."

'As the Sun has resorted to the direction (south) that serves the god of death, the north devoid of (the Sun) shines like a woman without the vermilion mark on the forehead.'

'Presently with the Sun far away, the Himalayas abounding in snow has naturally justified its name.'

'The days are enjoyable at noon as it is pleasant to move about during this time since the sun is not scorching. But the shade and water seem to be unfortunate (as they are not liked by any one.'

'The days will be frostsmitten. The Sun will also be mild. Due to heavy dewfall the weather will be cold with the blowing of the wind. Forests will be empty (as no animals would be seen moving around.)'

'At this time people do not sleep under the open sky. With the month of Pushya approaching, nights feel cool and look red due to frost. They prolong into three yamas. '

'With the radiance of the Sun dimmed, with its orb reddened by frost, the moon does not shine clear like a mirror blurred with breath.'

'On a fullmoon night the beams of the moon faded by forest look pale, dull like Sita scorched by the heat of the Sun.'

'The west wind which by nature feels cold at this time blows doubly cold, hit by snow.'

'The snowcold forest terrains are fertile with barley and wheat crops. As the Sun rises the swans and kraunchas produce pleasing notes.'

'The tops of rice crops shining like gold resemble the flowers of datepalm.The fields full of ripe paddy bending a little (under the weight of grains) look delightful.'

'The Sun risen at the distant horizon looks like the Moon, his lengthening rays covered with snow and dew.'

'The heat of the Sun which we do not feel in the forenoon is comfortable during midday when the Sun shines slightly reddish white on earth.'

'As the miadows are wet with dewdrops, the land looks delightful with mild Sunlight  shining on the surface.'

' ', 'The wild tusker, extremely thirsty, touches the clean, cold water joyfully, but immediately withdraws its trunk unable to bear the cold.'

'Just as inefficient warriors do not enter the warfield, aquatic birds sitting near water do not venture to take a plunge into it.'

' ', 'The flowerless forest ranges appear as if they are asleep, enveloped in the darkness of frost and  snow .'

'Now the rivers are not visible as the waters are covered with vapour. They are only inferred through the cackling of swans and the sands of the bank moistened with dewdrops.'

' ', 'Due to snowfall, mildness of the Sun, and coldness (of weather) even the water flowing from the mountain top is not generally tasty.'

'The lotuses in the tank  no more shine (bright) as they are decayed by age, their filaments and pericarps withered with only stalks remaining.'

'At this time, righteous Bharata, the best among men, with his devotion to you must be sadly performing penance at his residence.'

'Giving up his kingdom, honour and pleasures of many kinds, Bharata will be living like an ascetic, sleeping on the ground in cold weather, his food under restriction.'

'At this time, Bharata,  accompanied by his subjects, must be daily going to river Sarayu for ablution.'

'How can Bharata who was brought up in luxury, who is delicate, and deserves all comfort, take a dip in river Sarayu (in cold morning) ?'

'He has a blue complexion, a pair of eyes like lotus petals, a thin waist and long arms. ', 'He is selfrestrained, softspoken, sweettempered and truthful. He knows his duty and maintains a low profile. A subduer  of enemies, he is heroic and great. Such Bharata has given up the diverse pleasures of life and has surrendered himself to you with all his soul.'

'Although you dwell in the forest, your great brother Bharata has won the kingdom of heaven by faithfully adopting your asceticism.'

"The saying that men follow mother's path but not the path of the father, has been disproved by Bharata."

'How could mother Kaikeyi, who has a husband like Dasaratha and a noble son like Bharata, be so wicked by nature ?'

'When pious Lakshmana said thus to Rama out of his love for him, Rama replied, unable to tolerate the words of censure against mother (Kaikeyi) :'

'O dear, Kaikeyi, our second mother, is never to be criticised like that. You may, however, speak more of Bharata, the lord of the Iksvakus.'

'Even though I have made up my mind to dwell in the forest and keep my vow, my love for Bharata makes me waver like a child (Rama does not want Bharata to suffer on his ', 'account).'

'I remember his dear, sweet, ambrosial  words, soothing to the heart and pleasing to the mind.'

'O enhancer of joy of the Raghus  when shall I meet great Bharata, brave Satrughna and you all together?'

'Expressing his grief in such manner, Rama reached Godavari where he took his bath with his brother and Sita.'

'And then poised, they offered libations of water to their forefathers and gods and prayer to the rising Sun.'

'Accompanied by Sita and Lakshmana,Rama finished his bath in the river.He looked splendid like Lord Rudra followed by Nandi and the daughter of the king of  the mountains (Parvati). ', 'इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे षोडशस्सर्गः।।', 'Thus ends the sixteenth sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.'

'Ablution over, Rama, accompanied by Sita and Lakshmana, went back from the bank of the river Godabari to their hermitage.'

'On reaching the hermitage, Rama and Lakshmana performed the forenoon rituals and entered the leafthatched cottage.'

'Honoured by the ascetics , Rama  stayed there peacefully with brother Lakshmana, ', 'discussing diverse matters (from time to time).'

'Longarmed Rama seated with Sita in the cottage, appeared like the Moon in conjunction with constellation Chitra.'

'While Rama was thus seated, engrossed in conversation, there incidentally appeared a demoness.'

'Surpanakha, sister of the tenheaded demon (Ravana) approached Rama shining like a god.'

'The demoness was infatuated with Rama,  whose chest was like that of a lion, who was strongarmed, who had a glowing face, pleasing to the eyes, who walked with the gait of an elephant, whose hair was matted,  who was gentle and strong who was, endowed with royal traits, who had a blue lotuslike complexion, who was handsome as the god of love, and who resembled Indra.'

"Rama's face was lovely, Surpanakha's was hideous. Rama had a slender waist, she had a huge belly. His eyes were large,  hers were deformed. His hair was black and beautiful, hers was coppercoloured. He was lovely in appearance, she was ugly. His voice was sweet, hers was shrill. He was young, she was dreadfully old. He was positive, she was perverted. Rama was wellbehaved, she was wicked. Rama was just and loving while she was overcome by lust.  (This) demoness said to Rama :"

'O Rama you are wearing matted hair like an ascetic, but living with your wife and holding bow and arrows. What brings you to this place haunted by demons ? You should tell me the truth ?'

'Thus asked by the demoness Surpanakha,  Rama, scorcher of foes began telling her everything due to his simplemindedness.'

'To Rama untruth is never acceptable at the hermitage and especially in the presence of a woman.'

'(Rama replied) There was a king named Dasaratha who was mighty like the gods. I am his eldest son known among the people as Rama.'

'Here is Lakshmana , my younger brother, who always follows me . And this  is the daughter of the king of Videha and my wife, wellknown as Sita. '

'I have come here, commanded by the king, my father and mother.Intending to obey the orders of my father, and impelled by duty to  establish righteousness I have come  to reside here. '

'I wish to know who you are. Tell me who your kins are. With lovely limbs you do not appear to be a demoness.'

'Tell me truly what you have come here for. Having heard the words of Rama and overtaken by passion, the demoness said:'

'My name is Surpanakha. I am a demoness who can assume any form at will, I move in this forest alone, unleashing a reign of terror.'

'My brother is Ravana, son of Visrava, and lord of all demons. You have heard his name I suppose.'

'Kumbhakarna is another brother of mine. He is very strong. He is always in deep sleep. Vibhisna another brother. He is righteous free from  any demoniac trait. My other two brothers are Khara and Dusana who are wellknown heroes of war.'

'Setting them aside, I came here, as soon as I saw you. You are the finest among men and I am here wishing you to be my husband.'

'I have influence over others, I have capacity to move wherever I want. Be my husband forever. What will you do with Sita?'

'She is ugly, deformed, unsuitable for you. I  am alone  fit for you. Look upon me as your wife.'

'I will devour your brother along with this disfigured, unchaste and fearful lady with a flat belly.'

'O darling, thereafter you can keep wandering with me in this Dandaka forest, enjoying the beauty of the mountain tops and forests. '

'Thus addressed, Rama, skilled in speech, laughed and started speaking to that woman of bewitching eyes.', 'इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे सप्तदशस्सर्गः।।', 'Thus ends the seventeenth sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.'

'To  Surpanakha bound by the noose of passion Rama with a smile replied in a clear, lucid manner:'

'O lady I am married and here is my wife who is dear to me. To be a cowife to some one is indeed painful for people like you. '

'Here is my younger brother Lakshmana. He is a man of good conduct, good look, valiant and virtuous. (Besides) he is not with his wife.'

'He is not with his wife, and is in need of one. He is young, handsome and worthy. He will be an appropriate husband to you.'

'O  woman of large eyes and fine hips, my brother is fit for you. You will (with him) shine like the radiant Sun on mount Meru. You will enjoy yourself without a cowife. You may approach him.'

'Thus  told by Rama, the demoness, deluded with lust, left him suddenly, and said to ', 'Lakshmana:'

'With my fine complexion, I will be a suitable wife for you. You can happily wander about in Dandaka forest with me.  '

'Thus addressed by the demoness Lakshmana, son of Sumitra, wellversed in the use of words gave her a befitting reply :'

'O lotuscomplexioned woman , how can you act as a maid to a slave ? Why do you intend to be so? I am already dependent on my revered brother.'

'O largeeyed one, you have a clear complexion. You may become the younger wife of my master who is lord of great wealth. And live a happy, fulfilled life.'

'He will abandon this uglylooking, unchaste, frightening old woman of drooping belly and accept you alone as his wife.'

'O lady of fair complexion and beautiful hips, which wise man will fall in love with any other female giving up a fine figure like you ?'

'While Lakshmana was thus making fun of the dreadful, droopingbellied Surpanakha, she presumed his words to be true.'

'Deluded with passion, Surpanakha said to formidable Rama, the scorcher of foes,  seated in the leafthatched hut along with Sita:'

'You are holding on to this lady who is ugly, unchaste, fiercelooking, flatbellied and  aged and not caring for me.'

'I shall eat up this woman now before your very eyes and I can move about happily with you without a cowife.'

'While speaking this, Surpanakha, with eyes like flaming amber ran to the fawneyed Sita in great anger like a giant meteor hurtling towards the constellation of Rohini : '

'Mighty Rama in a rage restrained her who was falling upon Sita like the noose of death, and said to Lakshmana:'

'O handsome Lakshmana it is not proper to cut jokes with wicked, uncivilized persons. Now see Sita who has somehow survived.'

'O tiger among men, this uncouth, bigbellied, unchaste and highly passionate demoness deserves to be formed.'

'Thus instructed (by Rama), powerful Lakshmana took position by the side of Rama, angrily lifted the sword and cut off her nose and ears.'

'Dreadful Surpanakha with her ears and nose cut off, roared in a hoarse voice and ran ', 'away into the forest in the same direction as she came.'

'The dreadful demoness who thus was disfigured. Drenched in blood, she  thundered like a cloud in rainy season.'

'Dripping blood profusely, the frightful demoness lifted her arms and entered the great forestroaring.'

'A disfigured demoness, she fell down like the thunderbolt from the sky on the ground while her fiercelooking brother Khara sat surrounded by demons at Janasthana.'

'Thereafter the sister of Khara, wild with fear and delusion and drenched in blood, narrated all about the arrival of Rama, Sita and Lakshmana in the forest and her disfigurement.', 'इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे अष्टादशस्सर्ग।।', 'Thus ends the eighteenth sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.'

'Burning with anger to see his sister fallen down disfigured and drenched in blood, Khara enquired:'

'Get up, give up your confusion and stupefaction. Tell me clearly by whom you have been disfigured like this ?'

'Who will hurt  an innocent, venomous black serpent and stay away quietly close by for fun with his finger tip?'

'Who is he who has tied has tied his throat with the noose of death out of ignorance and yet does not know the implications ? Who is he who has caused this injury to you, but does not understand that he has drunk deadly poison.'

'You have sufficient strength and courage. You are capable of  moving as you like and taking any form at your will. By whom have you been brought to this state and drawn close to death?'

'Which valiant person among gods, gandharvas, sages and other great people, has disfigured you like this ?'

'I can see none in this world who can offend me, nor even the thousandeyed Indra among the gods.'

"Just as the swan drinks only milk from water (mixed with milk), my arrows will (unerringly) drain the life from the enemy's body right now."

'Whose foamy, red blood will the earth drink while I strike his vital organs with my arrows in the fight ?'

'Whose flesh will be eaten by cheerful flocks of (vultures), biting and tearing his body when he is killed by me in the battle ? '

'Neither gods nor devils nor gandharvas nor even demons will have the power to rescue that hapless creature dragged by me ruthlessly in the battle.'

'You should tell me as you slowly regain your consciousness which bragart has overpowered you in the forest with his strength. '

'On hearing her angry brother, Surpanakha replied with words choked with tears:'

'Here are two young sons of Dasaratha, Rama and Lakshmana, who are gentle, handsome,  strong, with eyes like white lotus, wearing deerskin and bark robes, living on fruits and roots, selfrestrained like ascetics and following the righteous path.'

'They are kings of the gandharvas with all royal insignia. I was not able to discern whether they are gods or humans.  '

'I saw between them a young, beautiful woman of slender waist, adorned with all kinds of jewels.'

'I have been subjected to this state of an orphan unfaithful woman by both of them for the sake of that lady. '

'I wish to drink the foamy blood of that crooked woman and of both the brothers slain on the battle front.'

'O dear  this is my first wish and you must fulfil it. I will drink her blood and  of the two brothers, in the battle.'

'As she was speaking, the inflamed Khara ordered fourteen very strong demons, comparable to Yama, the god of death, to proceed.'

'Two human beings equipped with weapons, clad in bark robes and deerskin have entered the dreadful Dandaka forest along with a woman of bewitching beauty.'

'I want you to get  both of them along with that notorious woman killed. This sister of mine will drink their blood. '

"O demons quickly go and crush them with your power and fulfil my sister's sincere wish."

'Thus commanded, the fourteen demons along with Surpanakha rushed there like windblown clouds.'

'The nightrangers were unable to crush him(Rama) despite their sharp, glowing weapons  just as wild elephants cannot face all at once the rising flame of the forest fire.', 'इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे एकोनविंशस्सर्गः।।', 'Thus ends the nineteenth sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.'

'The frightful Surpanakha came to the hermitage of Rama and showed both the brothers and Sita to the demons.'

'They saw mighty Rama together with Vaidehi and Lakshmana sitting in the leafthatched cottage.'

'Seeing the demons along with Surpanakha arrive, said the handsome Rama, scion of the Raghu dynasty to his brother Lakshmana, who was blazing like fire :'

'O Lakshmana  stand by Sita for a while. I shall kill these demons who have come here.'

'Lakshmana heard him and in turn honoured the word of Rama, knower of the self.'

'Righteous Rama too, lifted up his great bow decked with gold and fastened the string and then said to the demons:'

'We, Rama and Lakshmana, sons of Dasaratha, are brothers, who have entered the inaccessible Dandaka forest along with Sita.'

'Feeding on fruits and roots and following the righteous path, we are living in Dandaka forest like ascetics. Why are you torturing us?'

'I came here equipped with bows, arrows and weapons, asked by ascetics to kill in the battle sinners like you who are offending them.'

'If you care for your life, you may return, or else, if you please you may remain (die) here, O demons.'

'At these words, the destroyers of brahmins, the fourteen demons were inflamed. They lifted their spears and spoke:'

'You have incited the wrath of Khara, our great master for which you will now pay with your life in the fight.'

'How can you face us alone? We outnumber you? Leave alone fighting, you cannot even stand in front of us.'

'Come on with daggers and sharpedged spears hurled, you will give up your life,your prowess as well as the bow held in your hand.'

'Saying these words, the fourteen infuriated demons hurled their spears at invincible Rama.'

'All the fourteen spears hurled turned into splinters by the same number of golden arrows released by Rama. '

'Then the effulgent Rama, mighty angry, took fourteen arrows sharpened by stones and glowing like the  Sun.'

'Rama took the bow, stretched it and aimed at his target, the demons  and sent the arrows as Indra would release the thunderbolt.'

'Goldfeathered blazing arrows decorated with gold, released by Rama flew fast and pierced the chests of the demons. Drenched in blood they (the arrows) thundered (out of their chests) and  plunged into the earth.'

'With their hearts split, their bodies drenched in blood, disfigured and lifeless, the demons fell down on earth like trees cut  at the roots.'

'Seeing the demons fallen on the ground, the demoness wild with anger and fear roared.'

'Her blood slightly dried up, she came back afflicted to Khara and fell down like a sallaki tree, its sap oozing.'

'Missing'

'Then desperately screaming and shedding tears with a sad face beside her brother, she roared again and again.'

'When Surpanakha saw the demons fall dead on the battleground, she ran to Khara,her brother and told in detail about the death of the demons.', 'इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे विंशस्सर्गः।।', 'Thus ends the twentieth sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.'

'Seeing Surpanakha collapse, Khara said in clear terms about the unfortunate situation she had created:'

' ', 'The valiant demons who feed on blood have been commissioned for your pleasure. Why are you crying again?'

'They are loyal and faithful to me. They are always my wellwishers. Even when attacked, they cannot be killed. They never fail to carry out my orders.'

'I wish to know what makes you lament and roll on the ground like a serpent and hissing? '

'When I am here like a lord to protect you, why do you weep like an orphan? Get up. Give up your anxiety. Be not afraid.'

'Thus consoled by Khara, invincible Surpanakha wiped her tearful eyes and said to her brother:'

'My ears and nose sliced off, drenched with blood, I came to you and you pacified me.'

'O warrior  you had sent, out of anger, fourteen demons to put an end to Rama along with Lakshmana in order to please me.'

"The demons who went with spears in their hands were killed, their hearts pierced by  Rama's arrows."

"Seeing the powerful demons collapse on the ground in a moment's time through Rama's action, I was frightened."

'O demon  I am scared and sad. To me everything looks frightening. I, therefore, seek refuge in you.'

'I am drowned in a vast sea of sorrow where crocodiles in the form of distress reside. It is full of rows of waves of fright. Why do you not save me?'

'The demons who live on flesh, who came following me fell down on earth and lay dead,  shot by the sharp arrows of Rama.'

'O demon  if you have compassion for me or for the demons, if you have the power and energy to face Rama, kill the enemy of the demons living in Dandaka forest.'

'If now you do not kill that Rama, my enemy, O shameless one, I will give up my life in your very presence.'

'Instinctively I can foresee that you and your army do not have the capability to encounter that great Rama in a fight.'

' ', 'You call yourself a hero, yet are not able to kill two humans like Rama and Lakshmana. Your claim to heroism is false. You are not a hero at all.'

'O demon  you are a disgrace to the family. If you have power or energy, kill that Rama dwelling in Dandaka forest.'

'You have little strength and less heroism. You with your relations should immediately leave Janasthana. What kind of position do you have here?'

'Let down by the brilliance of Rama, son of Dasaratha, you will be soon destroyed. He is mighty and his brother who has disfigured me is very valiant.'

'Overcome by sorrow, the bigbellied demoness cried  in several ways and being very sad started beating her chest with both hands.', 'इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे एकविंशस्सर्गः।', 'Thus ends the twentyfirst sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.'

'Ashamed and accused thus in the presence of the demons, the valiant Khara spoke to Surpanakha in harsh words: '

'Like the overslowing salt sea water, I am unable to contain this my excessive anger arising out of your insult.'

'Rama is a shortlived human. I do not care for his valour. His life span will be shortened (he will be killed) now for his own misdeeds. '

'Restrain your tears and your anxieties I will send Rama along with his brother to the abode of Yama.'

"With his life ebbing out, killed by my axe in the fight, you will drink today, O demoness, Rama's red, hot blood."

"On hearing the words that came out of Khara's mouth, she was pleased. And in stupidity began praising her brother once again as the best of demons."

'Khara, accused by her earlier and admired again, said to Dusana, chief of army:'

'There are fourteen thousand demons at my command ready to act according to my will. They are warriors of terrific speed and will not retreat from the fight. '

'They are of the colour of the dark blue cloud, dreadful and merciless, strong and powerful fighters who roam about forturing people.'

'O handsome one, get them all, powerful like tigers, demons with large countenances, mighty and arragant, ready (for the fight). '

'O goodnatured one, get my chariot, bows and arrows, wonderful swords of different kinds and sharp missiles ready quickly.'

'O expert in warfare, I wish to lead those great warriors of Paulasthya family, to kill that immodest Rama.'

'While Khara was speaking thus, Dusana reported that a huge chariot of the colour of the Sun yoked with good horses of variegated hues stood ready.'

'Then the impatient Khara mounted the chariot that looked like the peak of mount Meru. It was decorated with pure gold, had golden wheels, poles studded with vaidurya. The carriage of the chariot was engraved with golden figures of fishes, flowers, trees, the Sun, stars, flocks of auspicious birds, flags and swords. Shining with small bells, it was yoked to fine horses. '

'The demons of terrific prowess surounded Khara and Dusana and stood by, when they saw both of them mounting the chariot.'

'Khara mounted the chariot, saw the demons holding great weapons, wearing dreadful shields and holding flags, and ordered them to march.'

'Then the army of the demons wearing dreadful shields, holding weapons and flags, and making a loud noise started in great speed from Janasthanam.'

'The fourteen thousand demons loyal to the wishes of Khara, took in their hands, maces, piercing weapons, spears, sharp axes used in battle, swords, wheels, splinters, iron clubs, powerful missiles, dreadful iron bars of giant size, bows made of bamboo, clubs and frightening weapons like thunderbolt (of Indra) and  departed from Janasthana.'

"Khara's chariot moved a bit behind the army of demons of frightening prowess who rushed forward to attack (Rama). "

'Knowing the mind of Khara, the charioteer hastened the horses of the colourful  chariot decorated with pure gold. '

'Spurred by the charioteer, the chariot of Khara, the slayer of enemies, produced a rattle that filled all four quarters and the intermediate directions.'

'Khara in extreme anger hastened, like Yama, to slay his enemy. He roared loudly like a cloud raining hail stones and impelled his charioteer to speed up. ', 'इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वालल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे द्वाविंशस्सर्गः।।', 'Thus ends the twentysecond sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki. '

'As the army marched from there (Janasthana) a huge dark cloud of the colour of an ass rained dreadful inauspicious water, red as blood.'

'The swift horses yoked to the chariot stumbled casually while galloping on the plane highway sprinkled with flowers.'

"A dark ring, bloodred in colour appeared on the border of the Sun's orb, dark in the ", 'middle. This phenomenon of the Sun appeared like a ring of moving charcoal covering the Sun.'

'A huge vulture, frightening to look at flew up and sat on top of the flag on the staff of gold.'

'Flesheating beasts and birds flocked at Janasthana producing a cacophony. '

'The dreadful jackals making ghastly howls turning towards the illuminated direction and produced frightening sounds indicating inauspicious time for the demons.'

'The clouds looked like shattered mountains pouring down bloodlike rain which filled the sky and made it appear frighteningly different. '

'A terrific darkness, spread all over, produced frightening horripilation. Even the four quarters and the intermediary zones were not discernible.'

'Even before Sunset the twilight looked like a fresh wound. Then wild animals, birds, kankas, jackals and vultures facing towards Khara screeched, indicating danger.'

' ', "Bad omens that always bring inauspiciousness were a dreadful evidence of what is going to happen. Jackals howled, facing Khara's army with their mouths emitting fire. "

'The planet Ketu appeared  like an iron beam near the Sun. Although it was not the fullmoon or newmoon day, Rahu eclipsed the Sun. Wind blew hard and the Sun was lustreless.'

'The stars rose in the sky and glittered like fireflies even before night arrived. The fishes and the aquatic birds in the lotusponds hid themselves under water.  Lotuses dried up in tanks and the trees stood bereft of flowers and fruits.'

'Although there was no wind, dust rose like a brown cloud and the sarika birds sang (vichi kuchi) thoughtlessly. '

'Dreadful to watch were the thunderstorms and the meteors that dropped down from the sky. The earth trembled all over with mountains, groves and forests. '

'While the intelligent and courageous Khara was seated on the chariot and shouting, ', 'his left shoulder shook violently and throat throttled.'

' ', 'While watching all this, his eyes brimmed with tears. His forehead ached. Yet he was too deluded to beat a retreat. '

'Looking at these dreadful, horripilating occurrences Khara laughed and said to the demons:'

'Valiant and strong, I do not take seriously these terrifying omens boding calamity  just as a strong man does not care for the weak.'

'With my sharp arrows I can even bring down the stars from the sky. If angered, I can cause mortality to the god of death.'

'I do not wish to return, without killing with my sharp arrows that Rama who is proud of his strength and his brother Lakshmana.'

'Let my sister be satisfied by drinking the blood of both Rama and Lakshmana on whose account this adversity has come.'

'I have never faced defeat in wars, and all of you have seen it with your eyes. I am not telling you a lie.'

'When angry, I can kill even (Indra) the wielder of the thunderbolt, rider of the intoxicated Airavata and lord of the gods. What to speak of these two petty humans? '

'Fallen into the deathtrap, the great army of the demon, felt very happy on hearing Khara roaring.'

'Great souls like sages, gods, gandharvas, and siddhas including celestial bards assembled to see the battle.'

"Holy men assembled and uttered benedictions, saying, 'let there be wellbeing for the cows and brahmins associated with men of pious deeds in all the (three) worlds. "

"'Let Rama conquer the descendants of Paulasthya in the war like Visnu, the wielder of the wheel had defeated great demons'."

'The great ascetics were talking thus and more. The gods waiting eagerly on heavenly chariots saw the army of the demons whose life span was shortened (who were doomed to death).'

'Seeing Khara, their chief on the chariot driving fast, the army of demons too marched forward. '

'Surrounded by twelve valiant warriors like Syenagami, Pruthugreeva, Yagnasatru, Vihangama, Durjaya, Karaviraksha, Parusha, Kalakarmuka, Meghmali, Mahamali, Sarpasya and Rudhirasana, Khara proceeded.'

'Similarly Dusana proceeded with four  Mahakapali, Sthulaksha, Pramathi and Trisira  around him. '

'The mighty, swiftfooted army of valiant demons surrounded the princes (Rama and Lakshmana) all on a sudden like the planets around the Sun and the Moon.', 'इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे त्रयोविंशस्सर्गः।।', 'Thus ends the twentythird sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki. '

'When Khara endowed with malicious might was marching towards the hermitage, Rama and his brother saw the same omens of impending calamity the demon had seen.'

'When Rama saw the most dreadful, horripilating phenomena foreboding calamity, he said to Lakshmana:'

'O longarmed Lakshmana see these calamitous phenomena that forebode mass destruction of men and demons.'

'These rumbling clouds, brownishred like the colour of a donkey,  are moving about in the sky showering streams of blood. '

'O Lakshmana all my arrows are smoking and this goldplated bow welcomes me to war. '

' ', 'The way the forestbirds are screeching makes me foresee danger and makes survival doubtful.'

'A mass destruction of life is going to take place. There is no doubt about it. O brave Lakshmana my right shoulder trembles again and again, indicating the defeat of the enemy. Your beaming visage presages victory. '

'O Lakshmana, while preparing for war, those whose faces look pale are, for sure, going to die. '

'A dreadful roar of demons and the loud sound of wardrums beaten by the wicked demons are heard.'

'A wise man who apprehends danger or one who desires his own good should plan his defence even before the onset of danger.'

'Therefore, take shelter along with Sita in the inaccessible mountain cave, overgrown with trees, ready with your bow and arrows. '

'O dear, I do not like you to oppose this word of honour. You must touch my feet and ', 'go without delay. '

'You are valiant and strong. There is no doubt that you can kill all these demons. But I desire to kill them.'

'Thus ordered by Rama, Lakshmana took the arrows and the bow and accompanied by Sita took shelter in the inaccessible cave.'

'With Lakshmana and Sita inside the cave, Rama heaved his shield, saying, Oh the work is accomplished. '

'Adorned with the shield, Rama shone like smokeless fire rising in darkness.'

'Valiant Rama lifted the huge bow and arrows and stood there, filling the directions with the twangs of his bow.'

'Then the gods along with gandharvas, siddhas, and celestial bards assembled there, wishing to witness the war.'

'Great ascetics of the world, distinguished brahmarsis, accomplishers of pious deeds assembled and said to one another:'

"'Let there be wellbeing for the cows, brahmins, and all the worlds. Let Rama, the scion of the Raghu race, conquer the Paulastyas (demons) in war like lord Visnu, wielder of the disc, who defeated the most powerful demons'."

'Thus looking at one another they discussed among themselves how there can be war between the righteous Rama fighting singlehanded on the one hand and the fourteen thousand demons, performers of terrific deeds, on the other.'

'Rajarsis, siddhas, great brahmins with their clan and gods on the celestial chariots waited to see the war whetted with curiosity.'

'Seeing Rama standing on the war front, engrossed and radiating heroic lustre, all beings were alarmed.'

'Rama, who is unwearied in action and who is of an incomparable (lovely) form, looked ferocious like the wielder of Pinaka (Lord Siva).'

'Then appeared on all sides the wellequipped army of demons raising deep sounds with dreadful shields, weapons and banners.'

'The forest was filled with tumultuous sounds of the warriors roaring like lions,  shouting at one another, stretching the bowstrings constantly, yawning, proclaiming loudly and beating the drums.'

'The ferocious animals of the forest got frightened and ran away to silent spots without looking back.'

'The fierce army, deep like the sea, equipped with various missiles approached Rama. '

'Rama, wellversed in warfare, cast his eyes on all sides to see the army of Khara that had come prepared for war.'

'Rama stretched the formidable bow and lifted the arrows from his quiver to kill the demons and assumed intense anger.'

"Rama stood burning in anger like the fire of the doom's day. It was difficult even to look at him. Seeing him full of glow even the sylvan deities ran away."

'Rama in anger looked like Lord Siva ready to destroy the sacrifice of Daksha. '

'Seeing Rama flashing (in anger) and standing on the warfront all creatures ran away frightened. '

'The army of demons equipped with blazing armour, bows and banners appeared like a mass of blue clouds at Sunrise.

'Khara accompanied by his pilot party arrived at the hermitage of Rama, the destroyer of enemies and saw him in fury, standing ready with his bow.'

'On seeing Rama, Khara held his terribly twanging bow and arrow, stood facing him, and ordered the charioteer to drive towards him.'

'Commanded by Khara, the charioteer also urged the horses towards the ', 'mightyarmed Rama standing alone and wielding the bow. '

'Seeing Khara attacking (Rama) all the demon ministers surrounded him  roaring. '

'Seated on a chariot in the midst of the demons, Khara looked like the rising Mars in the middle of the stars.'

'Khara struck Rama of immeasurable prowess with a thousand arrows and roared loudly.'

'Thereafter all the infuriated demons showered on invincible Rama, wielder of a fierce bow, many kinds of weapons.'

'Overtaken by anger, the demons continuously hurled at Rama hammers, spears, spikes, barbed missiles, swords and battleaxes.'

'Very powerful demons like huge clouds roared, eager to kill Rama in war. They ran forward on chariots, horses and tall elephants, looking like  mountain tops.'

'The battalions of demons sent down streams of arrows on Rama just like clouds  downpour on mountains.'

'Surrounded by the terrible demons Rama appeared like Lord Siva at dusk with hosts of his retinues arounds.'

'Rama resisted the weapons released by the demons like the sea, the inflow of river waters.'

'Rama remained unhurt like a great mountain struck by many glowing thunderbolts. He felt no pain even though his limbs were hit by the dreadful weapons.'

'Wounded all over the body, bleeding through the wounds caused by weapons, Rama looked like the evening Sun covered with clouds.'

'Seeing Rama left alone surrounded by many thousands of demons, the gods, ghandarvas and siddhas became very sad.'

'Thereafter Rama, mighty angry, bent his bow and released hundreds and thousands of unfeathered arrows.'

"As if sporting, Rama discharged the arrows attached with herons' feathers. The arrows were inescapable, unbearable like that of Yama's staff, that went straight without missing the target."

'The arrows like the noose of the god of death released by Rama on the enemy army easily destroyed the lives of the demons.'

"Rama's arrows pierced the bodies of the demons and drenched in blood, they, looking like burning fire, shone in the sky."

"From Rama's bow bent into a cirle, countless fierce arrows able to take the lives of demons were released."

'In war Rama cut asunder the bows, flag tops, armour and heads of demons, their shoulders and thighs that were like the trunks of elephants, in their hundreds and thousands.'

'He killed horses with golden armours yoked to the chariots along with charioteers, elephants along with riders, the cavalry along with their horses and infantry and sent them all to the abode of death.'

'The bodies of the demons torn into pieces by the very sharp iron arrows and by the arrows called vikarni, they cried and shouted aloud in pitiable voices.'

"Just like the dried up forest burnt by the fire, the army was totally destroyed by Rama's arrows that pierced into the vital parts of the soldiers."

'A few warriors of fierce strength approached Rama and hurled at him very powerful weapons, spears, swords and axes.'

'Strongarmed Rama attacked them with his arrows and cut off their heads and took their lives.'

"The heads, armour and bows fell down broken on the ground like trees in the wind gererated by Garuda's wings. "

'The rest of the demons hit by the arrows ran desperate towards Khara for refuge.'

'Pacifying them all, Dusana regathered them again and ran towards Rama like an angry Yama rushing towards Rudra.'

"Under Dusana's protection, all of them felt relieved from fear and, carrying sal and palm trees and stones as weapons, advanced towards Rama again."

'Holding spears, hammers and bows in their hands, the mighty demons rained on Rama weapons like arrows, trees and stones.'

'The thrilling, fierce, horrifying and horripilating battle again ensued betwen Rama and the demons. '

'As the infuriated demons again hurtled towards Rama, filling the quarters and the intermediate directions and raining missiles, Rama aimed at them dazzling gandharvastras, producing a frightening warcry. '

'Rama then let out from his bow, stretched round, thousands of arrows that covered all the ten quarters.'

'The demons, though wounded, could not see whereform the terrible arrows came. They only saw Rama shooting the arrows.'

'Through the darkness created by the arrows that covered the sky and the Sun, Rama looked as though he was vomitting them.'

'It seemed as if it all happened at the same time, the entire earth filling with demons seriously injured, slain and fallen down on the ground.'

'There were bodies of demons pierced and torn, thinned and fallen down, destroyed, broken and cut into pieces scattered in their thousands.'

"Slain thus by Rama's arrows, the ground was littered with (bodies of) demons with limbs dismembered, headdresses and shoulders cut off, arms, thighs and knees decked with various ornaments amputated, chariots, horses, best of elephants, fans made of the tail of chamari deer (used as an insignia of royalty), umbrellas, several  flags, and weapons like spears, swords, darts, battleaxes and stones crushed into pieces and arrows splintered and scattered all over. The ground looked frightening.", 'इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे पञ्चविंशस्सर्गः।।', 'Thus ends the twentyfifth sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.'

'Mightyarmed Dusana saw  the army  getting killed in war. He led the forces of five thousand demons, dreadfuly quick at fighting, dangeous to face and who will not beat a retreat.'

'The demons continuously hurled at him (Rama)  spears and swords and rained stones, trees and arrows from all sides'

'Righteous Rama, retaliated with his sharp arrows such as the rain of trees and stones, the mighty destroyers of life. '

'Rama retaliated in great anger to kill without caring for the shower of weapons like a bull with its eyes closed.'

'Overpowered by anger, Rama, with a blazing glow, covered Dusana and his army with his arrows.'

'Thereafter Dusana, chief of the army, angrily released at Rama equally powerful arrows comparable to thunderbolt.'

'Heroic Rama, mighty angry, then, broke the big bow of  Dusana, with his swordlike arrow. And with a series of four arrows cut his four horses to pieces.'

"After killing the horses with sharp arrows Rama severed the charioteer's head with an arrow of the shape of the crescent moon and pierced Dusana's chest with a set of three arrows."

"With his bow and chariot broken, charioteer and horses killed,  Dusana took up a spear in his hand that appeared like a huge mountain top. Bound by golden bands, covered the iron nails, wetted with the enemy's marrow it created a horripilation. It appeared as though it  could crush the army of gods and render the enemy powerless. It carried the killing touch of the thunderbolt and could break open the enemy's fort."

'With the spear that looked like a mighty serpent, Dusana, the cruel demon, advanced towards Rama.'

'Seeing Dusana going to pounce upon him, Rama cut off with two arrows both his arms adorned with armlets.'

'With the hands amputated, his huge spear, like the banner of Indra, slipped off his hands and fell down on the ground on the battle front.'

'Dusana fell down on the ground with broken hands like a proud elephant with both his tusks shattered.'

"Seeing Dusaana collapse dead on the ground, all beings hailed Rama, saying, 'Well done, well done'."

'Meanwhile all the three army chiefs, Mahakapala, Sthulaksha, and the mighty Pramathi ran towards Rama in anger, bound (as though) by the noose of death.'

'Mahakapala had a huge spear, Sthulaksha, a sharpedged spear and Pramathi, a battleaxe.'

'On seeing them rushing to attack him with sharp weapons, Rama received them quickly with pointed arrows as though they were guests.'

"Mahakapala's head was cut to pieces with sharp arrows and Pramathi was killed with a countless series  of arrows. Pramathi's body, like a huge tree with many branches collapsed on the ground."

'Rama filled the eyes of Sthulaksha with sharp arrows, and in anger shot five thousand arrows at the five thousand followers of Dusana in a moment and sent them to the abode of Yama.'

'Seeing Dusana and his followers killed, enraged Khara commanded his extremely strong army chiefs this way: '

'Dusana and his followers are killed in the battle. You, all the demons, along with your great army and different kinds of weapons should kill that wicked human being, Rama.'

'Having spoken thus, angry Khara ran towards Rama. Syenagami, Pruthugriva, Yajnasatru, Vihanga, Durjaya, Karaveeraksha, Parusha, Kalakarmuka, Meghamali, Mahamali, Sarpasya, Rudhirasanaall these twelve valiant army chiefs along with their forces rushed towards Rama, releasing the sharpest arrows at him.'

'Powerful Rama thereafter slayed the remaining army with his weapons studded with gold and diamonds and glowing like fire.'

'The goldtipped arrows which resembled fire covered with smoke shattered the army of demons like huge trees knocked down by thunder.'

'Rama killed a hundred demons  with one hundred arrows by a single stroke. The same way he killed a thousand of them with a thousand arrows on the battle front.'

'The demons fell down on the ground with their shields  and ornaments broken, their  bows stained with blood splintered.'

'The entire ground was littered with bodies of demons fallen in the battle with loose hair and with drops of blood on them looking like a great sacrificial altar strewn all over with kusa grass.'

'With the slaughtered bodies of demons lying on the ground, the forest in a moment looked very dreadful like hell with the mud of soil soaked with flesh and blood. '

'Fourteen thousand formidable demons were killed by Rama, a pedestrian human,  singlehanded.'

' ', 'Of that entire army great warrior Khara,Trisira and Rama, destroyer of foes alone remained.'

'The rest of the mighty, dreadful, intolerable demons were killed on the war front by ', 'Rama, elder brother to Lakshmana.'

'Thereafter seeing the formidable army killed by mighty Rama, Khara lifted a thunderbolt like Indra, and advanced towards Rama in a great chariot.', 'इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वालमिकिय आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे षङ्विंशस्सर्गः।।', 'Thus ends the twentysixth sarga in Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.'

' ', 'As Khara advanced towards Rama, Trisira the chief of the army approached him and said these words:'

' ', 'O valiant one assign this work to me. Refrain from this audacity. See how I am going to put down the mightyarmed Rama in the battle.'

' ', 'I promise you on my weapon that I will kill Rama.He who killed all demons deserves to be slain.'

'Restrain yourself for a moment from the enthusiasm to fight the war. Please act as an arbitrator and see who is killing whom.'

' ', 'If Rama is killed be happy and go to Janasthana or else if I am killed you can fight.'

' ', "When Khara was prevailed upon by Trisara in that manner with a wish to face death, Khara  permitted him  by saying 'You may go and fight'.Accordingly he advanced towards Rama."

' ', 'Trisira who looked a mountain with three peaks also got horses harnessed to a shining chariot and to attack Rama proceeded.'

' ', 'Trisira unleashed a stream of arrows like a huge cloud (releasing rain). They produced sound, a drum drenched with water, creates.'

' ', 'On seeing demon Trisira advancing towards him, Rama shook sharp arrows off his bow. '

'The tumultuous combat between Rama and Trisira looked like the strong fight between a lion and an elephant.'

' ', 'Then Rama hit  with three arrows on the forehead by Trisira flew into a fury and said in a state of great excitement:'

' ', 'Oh see the strength of this undaunted demon whose arrows fell like flowers on my forehead and only left a scratch.'

' ', 'Receive the arrows released from my bowstring. Saying so, the angry and agitated Rama discharged fourteen arrows, venomous like a snake, on the chest of Trisira .'

' ', "With four arrows having strong joints, the mighty hero (Rama) threw down his enemy's four swiftfooted horses."

' ', 'Rama brought down the charioteer with eight arrows and with one tore down the lofty banner of the chariot to shreds.'

' ', 'Rama then hit the demon with arrows on his chest while he was running away from the broken chariot. The demon became numb.'

' ', 'The mighty Rama in fury dismembered the heads of that demon with three sharp and swift arrows.'

' ', "The demon with his heads decapitated, hit by Rama's arrows a little while ago, fell down, vomitting blood."

'Those surviving demons who were under the protection of Khara got scared and retreated fast and fled like deer frightened by a tiger.'

'Personally persuading the fleeing army to come back, the angry Khara leaped forward towards Rama just as Rahu approaches the moon.', 'इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे सप्तविंशस्सर्गः।।', 'Thus ends the twentyseventh sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.'

'Khara was overtaken by fear at the prowess of Rama, when he saw Dusana and Trisira killed.'

'Khara, the mighty demon, saw his large, irrepressible army killed. He saw Trisira and Dusana slain singlehanded by Rama. Nervous, he advanced towards Rama wage war just as Namuchi approached Indra.'

'Khara drew his strong bowstring in anger and released the bloodhungry arrows, which appeared like venomous snakes.'

'Khara, sat on the chariot, and with a twang of his bowstring released arrows in all directions, exhibiting his skill in the use of weapons.'

'When Rama, the great warrior, saw Khara approaching him, he fixed powerful arrows  on his bow and covered all directions and intermediate quarters with his arrows.'

'He rained sparkling arrows which were irresistible. He filled the sky with arrows just as the raingod fills it with rain without leaving any space.'

'The arrows released by Khara and Rama on one another filled the entire sky. Everywhere only arrows and no sky could be seen.'

'While they were engaged in the battle, eager to kill each other the sky was covered with arrow and the Sun could not be seen.'

'Then Khara shot Rama with Nalika darts and darts called Vikarni like goads hit a mighty elephant.'

'Demon Khara positioned on the chariot, bow in hand, appeared to all beings like Yama, god of death holding the noose.'

'Khara thought valiant Rama who had destroyed his whole army might be exhausted by now.'

'When Rama saw Khara aggressively advancing like a lion to attack him, he was not perturbed, for he knew he was a fawn before a lion (which Rama was).'

'Then Khara mounting a great chariot which was glowing like the Sun, advanced towards Rama just as an insect hurtles towards fire.'

'Exhibiting his agility of the hand, Khara shattered the bow and the arrow in the grip of Rama ,the  great soul.'

"The influriated Khara this time took up seven arrows blazing like Indra's thunderbolt  and hit his armour."

'The armour of Rama who looked radiant like the Sun fell on the ground, struck by the welljointed darts released by Khara. '

'Khara then attacked Rama of unequal strength in fight, with a thousand darts  and roared loudly.'

'Rama, scion of the Raghu race, afflicted by the darts in all parts of the body, glowed in his anger like smokeless fire burning.'

'Then Rama, destroyer of foes, strung another great bow of fearful sound in order to put an end to the enemy.'

'Thereafter Rama advanced, aiming at Khara the superior Vaishnava bow given by sage Agastya.'

'Rama took up in a rage the welljointed, smooth darts with golden feathers and broke the flag post of the chariot of Khara to pieces.'

'The beautiful, golden flag post, broken into several pieces, fell down on earth.It appeared as if the Sun had come down to earth at the behest of the gods.'

"Quite enraged, Khara who knew how to hit the tender parts (of the body) in an encounter sent out four arrows on Rama. It was like poking an elephant's limbs with a javelin."

'Rama, hit by the arrows released from the bow of Khara, all his limbs drenched in blood, became very furious.'

'The best among archers and a supreme shooter, he lifted the bow, fixed his target and released six arrows in the great fight.'

'Rama hit one arrow on the head, two on the shoulders and three of the shape of the crescent moon on the chest (of the enemy).'

'Enraged and effulgent Rama took up thirteen darts, radiant like the Sun, with a wish to kill the demon.'

"Rama, like Indra, strong and mighty, broke the yoke of Khara's chariot with one arrow, the four horses with four arrows, and with the sixth the charioteer's head, with three others the main pole of the chariot, with two the axle of the chariot, and with the twelfth Khara's bow and arrows were splintered. As if laughing at him, he pierced Khara's body with the thirteenth arrow."

'Then, with bow broken, chariot destroyed, horses and charioteer dead, Khara jumped  down the chariot and stood on the ground holding a mace.'

'Then the gods, along with great sages came down in aerial chariots and assembled there. Delighted, they adored Rama, the great warrior, with folded hands for the work done.', 'इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकिय आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे अष्टाविंशस्सर्गः।।', 'Thus ends the twentyeigth sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.'

'Effulgent Rama looked at Khara who stood with a mace in hand minus his chariot  and said to him first in a gentle voice and then harshly :'

'Although you command a huge army with many elephants, horses, chariots, etc.  you have done such cruel deeds that the entire world despises you.'

'One who  is wicked, does sinful deeds and causes distress to all beings, will not ', 'survive even if he is the lord of the three worlds.'

'O nightranger, one who does a horrific deed which is against the world will be killed like an evil serpent come near.'

'Whoever commits sinful deeds out of greed or passion and without realisation will be ruined at the end like a lizard that eats hailstone (and dies).'

'O demon  what benefit will you  get by killing the venerable ascetics, followers of righteous path residing in Dandaka forest?'

'Cruel people, who are despised by the world for their sinful deeds, will not  be prosperous for long just like trees with decayed roots.'

'Just as the trees bear flowers at the proper season, so also people will certainly reap the fruits of their terrible, sinful deeds at appropriate time. '

'O nightranger  people will reap the result of their sinful actions in this world soon like one eating poisonous food.'

'O nightranger  I have come with the orders of the king to put an end to the lives of the perpetrators of dreadful, sinful and offensive deeds in this world.'

'Now when I unleash the golden  arrows, they will pierce through your body and come out like serpents emerging from the anthill.'

'Slain by me in the battle today, you and your army will follow the righteous men eaten by you in Dandaka forest. '

'The great seers whom you have earlier tortured and killed will, from their aerial vehicles, see you fallen into hell.'

'O vile fellow, now you may strike at me as you please. I will make your head fall  down like a palm fruit.'

'Challenged by Rama  in that manner, Khara, his senses switched off, eyes turned red due to anger, replied laughing :'

'O son of Dasaratha, it is not praiseworthy to kill ordinary demons in war. Why do you praise yourself for it?'

'The valiant, strong and the best of men do not at all speak proudly of themselves  and their valour.'

'O Rama common people, having no control over themselves and the lowest of kshatriyas boast of themselves in the world in a meaningless way as you are doing (now).'

' ', 'When death comes in a battle no hero will name his race and boast of himself unnessarily.'

'All your meanness is exhibited by your boasting just as the kusa grass caught by fire appears like gold.'

'Indeed, (it is strange that) you do not see me holding a mace and standing here like an unshakeable mountain which contains minerals and supports the earth.'

'Just like lord Yama, holding a noose of death is alone enough to destroy the three ', 'worlds, I am alone sufficient to take away your life in war, a mace in hand.'

'Indeed, I shall not speak any more even though a lot can be said on you. But the Sun is about to set and it will be improper to wage war thereafter.'

'You have killed these fourteen thousand demons. Therefore, I will wipe their tears by destroying you.'

'Having said this, highly enraged Khara adorned with large shoulder bands, hurled  at Rama, his mace glowing like a thunderbolt.'

"The huge, blazing mace hurled by Khara's arms reduced the trees and shrubs into ashes and came close to Rama."

'The mace, which moved in the sky burning like the noose of death was shattered to pieces by Rama.'

'The mace shattered by the arrows of Rama , fell down scattered to pieces on the ground like a female serpent subdued by the force of mantras and medicine.', 'इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे एकोनत्रिंशस्सर्गः।।', 'Thus ends the twentyninth sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.'

"Rama, fond of dharma, broke into pieces Khara's mace with his arrows, and smiling at bewildered Khara, said:"

' ', 'O lowly demon, you have already exhibited all your strength. Inferior to me in energy, you are needlessly roaring.'

'The mace about which you boasted so much has betrayed your confidence. Shattered by my arrows it now lies on the ground.'

'You said you will wipe the tears of the dead demons. (Now) those words have proved false.'

'You are mean. You have false pride. You are of low behaviour. I shall take away your life, O demon,, Just as Garuda carried off the nectar.'

'Now with your throat split open by my arrows , the earth will drink your foamy blood full of bubbles.'

'With all your limbs covered with dust, both the arms dropped down and stretched  out  on the ground, you will sleep as though hugging the earth, like embracing a rare woman.'

'When you, O vile demon, will go into eternal sleep the Dandaka grounds will provide shelter to those who deserve it here.'

'O demon, when my arrows destroy your hold over Janasthana the sages will move freely without fear all over this forest.'

'Having lost all their relations, the demonesses, who were causing fear to others,will move away with faces full of tears. '

'Your wives, who have got a husband like you, must have been born to a befitting race. They will taste the pangs of sorrow today, for no reasons whatsoever.'

'O cruel, mean, vile fellow, you had been always opposing the brahmins who pour oblations in fire under fear.'

'When Rama was thus speaking in a state of excitement in the middle of war, the choleric Khara  started abusing him in a harsher tone.'

'You are very haughty. When there is every cause of fear you pretend fearlessness. Being in the grip of death you do not know what to speak and what not to speak.'

'Those bound by the noose of death, do not know what to and what not to do, as their six senses cease to function.'

'Having said thus to Rama with a frown on his face, Khara, looking around for something to strike him with, saw a huge sal tree not very far. '

"Khara, biting his lower lip, uprooted the tree , lifted it with his mighty arms, and shouting at Rama loudly hurled it at him, saying, 'You are dead'."

'Brave Rama shattered with a flood of arrows the tree falling over him and summoned sharp anger to end Khara in war.'

'Full of sweat and with the corners of his eyes turned red, Rama hit Khara with a thousand arrows in the encounter.'

'With his body pierced with arrows his blood started flowing like the waterfalls flow from mount Prasravana.'

' ', "Completely struck by Rama's arrows, Khara, intoxicated with the smell of  blood, ran speedily charging towards Rama."

'Rama who was an adept in the science of arms picked up his valour quickly and moved a step back (not  to give him an opportunity to strike), looking at the highly agitated Khara falling upon him, with his body fully drenched in blood.'

'Rama took a dart glowing like fire which resembled another Brahmadanda to kill Khara in the war.'

'Righteous Rama placed on his bow the dart given him by wise Indra, king of the gods, and shot it at Khara.'

"Bending the bow fully, Rama released the arrow roaring like a violent gust of wind, which fell on Khara's chest."

"Just as Yama was burnt by Rudra's fire(from his eyes) in Swetaranya, Khara collapsed on the ground consumed by the fire of Rama's arrow."

"Khara fell down just like Vrutra or Bala killed by Indra's thunderbolt or like Numuchi by the froth of the sea."

'Then the rajarsis, great seers gathered together, offered their worship to Rama  and said these words joyfully :'

'For this purpose, killer of Paka, the gIorious Indra (who can break a fortress), came to the hermitage of Sarabhanga.'

'You are brought to this place by the great sages who had cleverly devised a plan to kill the cruel sinners, these demons৷৷'

'O son of Dasaratha, you have accomplished such a task that hereafter the sages in ', 'Dandaka will discharge their rightful duties happily. '

'Meanwhile the wonderstruck gods along with the charanas (celestial bards) got together and began beating the drums and raining showers of flowers on Rama from all sides.'

"'In a little more than half a moment of this great war Rama had accomplished the terrific task of killing with sharp darts fourteen thousand demons, led by Khara and Dusana."

"'Rama who knows the self has performed a great work. Oh what prowess what efficiency  only lord Visnu could do this'. So saying all the gods went back to their respective destinations."

'In the mean time, heroic Lakshmana accompanied by Sita came out of the mountain cave happily and entered the hermitage.'

'Then victorious Rama having been worshipped by the seers and also by Lakshmana entered the hermitage.'

'On seeing Rama killing the enemies of the great sages for their happiness Sita felt glad and embraced her husband.'

'Sita, daughter of Janaka, was happy to see the demons killed by Rama who himself was unhurt.'

'Then the daughter of Janaka, cheerful Sita, who had a face bright like the moon, embraced Rama, destroyer of demons who was worshipped by the delighted sages. ', 'इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीये आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे त्रिंशस्सर्गः।।', 'Thus ends the thirtieth sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.'

'Quickly did Akampana leave Janasthana, and quickly he entered Lanka. He said to Ravana:'

'O king many demons dwelling at Janasthana including Khara have been killed. I manged to escape with much difficulty.'

'When Akampana thus reported to the tenheaded Ravana, his eyes reddened with anger. He spoke to Akampana as if he was burning him with his eyes :'

'He who has destroyed my beautiful Janasthana is sure to die. His life is under the control of others (his enemies). Where can he be(alive) in all the worlds?'

'One who has caused displeasure to me cannot be happy, be it Indra or Kubera, or Yama or even Visnu.'

'I am the destroyer of the destroyer (Yama). I can burn even that which burns (fire). I ', 'can infuse Death with the characteristics of death itself.'

'If angry, I can burn the Sun and even fire with my radiance. I can arrest  the speed of the wind instantly with my effort.'

'Akampana, out of fear, implored the inflamed Ravana with folded hands and faltering voice to spare him.'

'The tenheaded Ravana, lord of the demons, assured safety to Akampana, who  gratefully said these words without hesitation:'

"Dasaratha has  a young son,  by name, Rama. He has a body like a lion's. He has strong, round arms and his shoulders resemble those of a bull."

'He is a hero of great fame and unequal prowess. He has destroyed your Janasthana and also Khara along with Dusana.'

' ', "Having heard Akampana's words, Ravana, the lord of demons, sighed heavily like the king of serpents and said these words:"

'Did Rama come to Janasthana with Indra and the gods ? O Akampana   speak.'

"Hearing Ravana's words, Akampana continued telling about great Rama's strength and his exploits in war."

'Rama is his name. He looks very radiant. He is the best among the archers. Owner of divine weapons, he is comparable to Indra in war.'

'He is strong with bright red eyes. He has a deep voice with the resonance of a drum. ', 'His face is like the moon. Lakshmana, his younger brother, is similar to him in appearance.'

' ', 'Rama is prosperous. He is the best among kings. Lakshmana with him is like wind with fire. Rama has pulled down Janasthana.'

'Indeed, they are great men. No god came there (to lend him a hand). There is no need to investigate further about it.  The goldenfeathered arrows released by Rama turned into fivehooded serpents and consumed the demons.'

'Wherever the demons went they, gripped by fear, only saw Rama in front. O sinless sire In this manner your Janasthana was destroyed by him.'

"Hearing Akampana's words, Ravana said, I will go to Janasthana and kill Rama along with Lakshmana."

'Thus said by Ravana, Akampana responded, I will tell you what happened there. O king   listen to the strength and valour of Rama.'

'Rama is of great fame. When outraged, he is irrepressible. He can arrest with his arrows even the speed of a river (in spate).'

'Powerful Rama can pull down the sky along with the planets and stars. He can lift the drowning earth from the depth of the sea.'

'He is so very powerful that he can drown the earth by breaking the boundary of the sea. He can arrest the speed of the sea or of the wind with his arrows.'

'He is a tiger among men. He is so powerful that he can destroy the world and recreate the creatures once again by his valour.'

'O tenheaded one, just as it is not possible for sinners to attain heaven it is not possible for you or for the entire world of demons to win him in war'

'I do not think it is possible for gods and demons together to kill him, yet there is a way for his destruction. You may listen to me with single mindedattention:'

'Rama has a wife in this world, by name, Sita, who is beautiful, has a slender waist ', 'and a wellformed body. Adorned with gems, she is a jewel among women, '

'She has no equal among goddesses nor among gandharvis nor apasaras nor among demonesses. How can there be a peer of her among human beings ?'

"Abduct Rama's wife by force in that great forest and bereft of Sita, he will give up his life."

'Ravana, the strongarmed king of demons, relished the words of Akampana and pondering over the matter, said to him :'

'Yes, early in the morning I will go alone gladly with the charioteer and bring Vaidehi here to this great city.'

'Having said so, Ravana got on a chariot yoked with donkeys. It had the colour of the Sun. It illuminated all directions. Ravana left.'

'The great chariot of the demon king (Ravana) flying in the sky shone like the Moon in the cloud.'

'Ravana reached the hermitage of Maricha and met him who was the son of Tataka. The demon king was treated with food that can be chewed and food that can be eaten.'

'Maricha personally offered Ravana a seat. He offered him water and paid him obeisance. Making meaningful enquiries he said in appropriate words :'

'O lord of demons  O king hope every one is fine in the world of demons. O lord, (though) your sudden arrival puts me in doubt (about everything going right). '

'Having thus been asked by Maricha, glorious Ravana, who was eloquent in speech, spoke to him :'

'O dear, Rama who is capable of doing difficult deeds has killed my sentinels. The indestructible Janasthana has been routed in war. Could you help me in abudcting his wife ? (That is the only way to bring him to his knees).'

'Having heard Ravana ,the king of demons, Maricha said these words:  O king, who is that enemy of yours who, in the guise of a friend,  has told you about Sita? Though obliged by you, who is he that is not happy with you, O tiger among demons?'

'Tell me who asked you to bring Sita ? Who wishes to demolish the peak of the entire clan of demons ?'

"He who has encouraged you in this is your enemy, indeed. He wants you to pluck out the fangs from the serpent's mouth."

'By  whose action have you been led into this wrong direction? Who has hit you on your forehead while you were sleeping comfortably?'

'Rama is like a mighty tusker. His pure and high birth is his trunk. His wellbuilt and strong arms are his tusks. His brilliance in his ichor. Nobody can face this intoxicated elephant in battle.'

'Rama is a lion in the form of man, a lion on warfront with its tail touching the waist when angry. This lion is deft in killing deer in the form of clever demons. His body is full of arrows. The sharp swords are his pointed teeth. It does not behove you to rouse such a lion who is asleep.'

'O king of demons  it is not proper (for you) to jump into the extremely fierce mouth of the nether world known as Rama. Who can steal the bow from his mighty arms which are whirlpools of mud. His arrows are rows of waves in the flow of the great war.'

'O lord of Lanka, chief of the demons, be pleased to return to Lanka and enjoy yourself in  the company of your wives. Let Rama enjoy with his wife in the forest.'

'Thus advised by Maricha ,the ten headed Ravana returned and entered his best of homes in the city of Lanka .', 'इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे एकत्रिंशस्सर्गः।।', 'Thus ends the thirtyfirst sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.'

'Seeing Dusana, Khara and also Trisira along with the fourteen thousand demon warriors of terrific performance killed by Rama, singlehanded, Surpanakha roared     like a cloud.'

'Seeing Dusana, Khara and also Trisira along with the fourteen thousand demon warriors of terrific performance killed by Rama, singlehanded, Surpanakha roared     like a cloud.'

'Seeing the performance of Rama which is very difficult for others, Surpanakha got scared and went to Lanka, ruled by Ravana.'

'Surpanakha saw Ravana shining brilliantly, seated like Indra along with ministers and Maruts on top of the aerial chariot. '

'Ravana, sitting on the magnificent golden seat on a golden altar looked radiant like the Sun or the blazing fire.'

'Invincible to gods, gandharvas, all living beings, great sages and seers, he was like Yama, lord of death with wide open jaws.'

'He had scars of wounds caused by the thunderbolt received in war between gods and demons, and marks of scars on his chest made by tips of the the tusks of elephant Airavata.'

'Valiant Ravana had an attractive appearance with beautiful dresses twenty arms,ten heads, a broad chest  and brilliant royal marks. '

'Wearing burnished golden earrings, he looked bright like the glittering vaidurya. And with his wellformed arms, white teeth and  wide mouth, he looked like a mountain.'

'He was hit by the wheel of Visnu for hundreds of times during great wars and beaten by other weapons.'

' ', 'Ravana whose body was not hurt by the weapons in war with gods, who could perturb even the imperturbable seas, was quick  in action.'

'(He was) one who could lift and throw great mountains, torment even gods, violate  dharma at the root, and cast an evil eye on the wives of others.'

'He who could employ all divine weapons, disrupt sacrifices, had gone to the city of Bhogavati, defeated Vasuki and abducted the dear wife of Takshaka.'

' ', "Ravana went to mount Kailasa, conquered Kubera and took away forcibly his aerial chariot Pushpaka which can fly as per the rider's desire"

'Out of anger he destroyed all the gardens of gods like Chitraratha of Kubera full of lotusponds and Nandana, the pleasuregarden of Indra.'

'He was like the peak of a mountain. He could stop with his arms the great Moon and Sun from rising. He was a scorcher of enemies.'

'This steadfast Ravana who had in the past performed penance for ten thousand years in a dense forest offered his heads to the selfborn Brahma.'

'He was unafraid of death in the hands of gods or demons or gandharvas or pisachas or birds or snakes in war except humans.'

'The mighty Ravana  defiled the sacred Soma juice, worthy of oblations, extracted by ', 'Brahmins by chanting mantras in scrifices.'

'He disrupted sacrifices at the final stage. He killed brahmins. He was ruthless, harsh, and  merciless. He was involved in activities against human welfare.'

'That demoness , Surpanakha saw  her very strong,valiant brother Ravana who made all beings cry and created fear in all worlds'

'Resplendently attired, adorned with jewels, wearing beautiful gardlands, seated on a raised throne, he(Ravana) was like death to even the lord of death'

'On reaching Ravana, the lord of demons, the delight of the Paulastya dynasty, and the destroyer of enemies surrounded by ministers, the terrified, Surpanakha said these words:'

'Showing her body disfigured by great Lakshmana, Surpanakha, the fearless wanderer, overwhelmed with fear said these cruel words  to Ravana sitting with large, glittering eyes:', 'इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे द्वात्रिंशस्सर्गः।।', 'Thus ends the thirtysecond sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.'

'When the distressed, anguished Surpanakha met Ravana who makes the world weep, he was seated in the midst of his ministers. She addressed him these harsh words:'

'Intoxicated with the pleasures of passion, acting on your own, ungoaded and unguided, you do not understand the problems arising out of great fear, problems you ought to know.'

'Lustful and greedy, you are addicted to vulgar pleasures. People will not respect you like the fire on the crematorium.'

'A king who does not act at the right time will be ruined along with the kingdom and its works.'

'Just as elephants keep away from a muddy river, people will keep distance from the king who does not employ spies, does not give audience to his people and is not independent.'

'Kings who are not under their own control and cannot protect the country, do not attract the minds of the people like mountains inside sea water.'

'Having created enmity with selfrespecting persons like gods, gandharvas and demons, with a fickle mind and without spies how long can you continue as king ?'

'O demon  you are childish and foolish. You do not even know what ought to be known. How can you rule as a king?'

'The best among the victorious kings, who are not masters of their espionage, judicial system and their exchequer are equal to the laity.'

' ', 'Since kings can see things from a faroff place with the help of the spies they are called farsighted.'

'Since you have not engaged any spy you do not know when your own relatives were killed in Janasthana. I take you to be a fool surrounded by ordinary ministers.'

'One Rama alone killed all the fourteen thousand demons including Dusana and Khara, demons  capable of fierce exploits.'

'Rama, the effortless performer of formindable tasks, has assured safety to the sages. Peace and happiness was restored to Dandaka forest but Janasthana has been ravaged.'

"O Ravana, you are not aware of what  has happened to your own kingdom. You are avaricious, intoxicated, and under others' control. A great fear has been generated in your own kingdom."

'All living beings stop seeking refuge under a king who is, not a generous giver, but intoxicated, harsh, arrogant and fraudulent. They do not run to him for protection in times of calamity.'

'A king who is extremely arrogant, who is not acceptable to good people, who is selfconceited and cholerictempered will be murdered even by his own people at the time of adversity.'

'A king who does not do what ought to be done, does not fear what ought to be feared, will surely be dislodged from the kingdom and live a wretched life like a blade of grass.'

'Even dried up logs, or clods of earth, or a handful of dust may have some value but not a king who is dethroned.'

'Like a piece of cloth that is worn and discarded, like garlands put on  and crushed, a king dislodged from the kingdom is worthless even if he is capable.'

'A king who is alert, omniscient, has control over his senses, has a sense of gratitude and one of righteous conduct continues to rule for a long time.'

'The king who keeps both his eyes shut but keeps the eye of justice open, one who is free from anger and remains ever alert, is worshipped by the people. '

'O Ravana you are evilminded. You  are devoid of all these good qualities. Your spies could not know that there had been a great massacre of your fellowdemons.'

'A king who accuses others, who is addicted to sensual pleasures, who lacks a sense of judgement of  place and time, a sense of discrimination between virtue and vice and the right wisdom will destroy himself and the kingdom in no time.'

'Ravana, king of demons, wealthy, arrogant and mighty, listened to Surpanakha and pondered over the mistakes she mentioned.', 'इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे त्रयस्त्रिंशस्सर्गः।।', 'Thus ends the thirtythird sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.'

'Incensed at the harsh words Surpanakha used in the midst of ministers, Ravana said:'

'Who is Rama? What is his strength? How does he look? How valiant is he? For what purpose has he entered the impenetrable Dandaka forest?'

'With what weapons he has killed demons like Khara, Dusana and Trisira ? '

'Thus questioned by Ravana, the demoness, overcome by anger, began telling him about Rama faithfully:'

"Rama, Dasaratha's son, has long arms, large eyes. He is clad in deerskin and bark. He resembles Cupid."

"His bow resembles Indra's, He is adorned with gold bands. Drawing the bow, he releases glittering arrows like highly poisonous snakes."

'I could not see Rama in the dreadful war while he was pulling an arrow from the quiver, aiming the dart, and drawing the bowstring.'

'Just as Indra destroys the crop ready for harvest by raining hailstones, I have seen Rama killing the army with a shower of arrows.'

'Fighting alone on foot with his sharp arrows Rama killed within a span of one and a half muhurta, the fourteen thousand dreadful demons including Dusana and Khara.'

'Sages have been assured safety. Peace has been restored to Dandaka forest. As Rama, the great soul, who knows the self, hesitated to kill a woman, I was alone saved after this humiliation.'

'His brother called Lakshmana looks radiant. He is virtuous and courageous like him, valiant, devoted and loyal.'

'He is impatient, invincible, victorious, bold, intelligent and strong. He is even the right hand of Rama, his outer life.'

"Rama's beloved consort is a largeeyed lady. Her face is like the full moon. She is engaged in the wellbeing of her husband."

'She is an illustrious lady. She is goodlooking with her long hair, wellshaped nose and things. She appears to be the presiding deity of the forest, another goddess of wealth (Laxmi).'

'She is Sita, princess of Videha, a virtuous lady of golden complexion, a beautiful lady of slender waist and heavy hips.'

'I had not seen such a beautiful woman earlier, among the gandharvas, or yakshas, or kinneras. I have not seen such a beauty among the humans on earth.'

'Whosoever gets Sita as his wife, whoever she embraces happily will wish to live longer than Indra, the breaker of fortresses in this world.'

'She is a woman of good conduct, of praiseworthy beauty. She is matchless in her beauty on earth. She will be a suitable wife for you and you, a suitable husband for her.'

'O mightyarmed one  I have been disfigured by cruel Lakshmana as I was attempting to bring that lady of broad thighs, pointed breasts, heavy hips and a beautiful face to make her your wife.'

'If you see her today, this lady with a face like the fullmoon, you will (instantaneously) fall a victim to the arrows of the god of love. '

'If you intend her to be your wife, raise your right foot now and proceed to win her over.'

'O lord of the demons, do a favour to your clan by  killing that cruel Rama dwelling in the hermitage.'

' Kill Rama, that great warrior along with Lakshmana with sharp arrows and enjoy the  company of Sita happily as you like, with her husband dead.'

'If you like what I have said, do accordingly without any hesitation, O Ravana, lord of the demons.'

' ', 'Assess your own strength, O Lord of the demons, before you forcefully abduct that delicate Sita who is charming in all respects and make her your wife.'

'On hearing about the death of the demons including Khara and Dusana who fell to the straight and swift arrows of Rama, you should decide your course of action.', 'इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे चतुस्त्रिंशस्सर्गः।।', 'Thus ends the thirtytfourth sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.'

'Then hearing the horripilating words of Surpanakha, Ravana took leave of the ministers and went thinking about the task ahead of him.'

'Deliberating on the task ahead, duly considering the pros and cons, demerits and merits, strength and weakness, of the issue and having firmly decided within himself, he left for the beautiful coachshed.'

'Ravana went covertly to the coachshed and to the charioteer to get a chariot harnessed.'

'Thus ordered, the smart charioteer got the chariot of his choice harnessed in an instant.'

'The younger brother of Kubera (Ravana), the prosperous lord of the demons ascended ', 'the chariot which could go where he desired. Embellished with gold, studded with gems, harnessed with demonfaced donkeys, the chariot rolled towards the ocean, rumbling like a cloud.'

'Ravana, enemy of the gods, slayer of towering sages, with white yaktail fans, and white parasols, shining like smooth vaidurya, wearing pure gold earrings, clad in attractive attire, ten necks with twenty strong hands, ten heads looking like ten mountain peaks, a cloud in the sky encircled by lightnings and accompanied by cranes, ascended the chariot that could go wherever he desired.'

'Valiant Ravana wentwatching the mountains full of thousands of trees bearing flowers and fruits on the shore of the sea.'

'(The area) surrounded on all sides with lotusladen ponds filled with cool, sacred water, sprawling hermitages with elevated altars. '

'The place covered with banana plants and coconut trees  as well as blossoming sal and tamala trees was looking extremely beautiful.'

'The place looked charming with nagas, garudas, gandharvas, kinneras in their thousands and with the descendants of ajas, vaikhanasas, valakhilyas and with those who drink the rays of Sun and Moon for survival, with  sages who were highly disciplined in the intake of food,  spiritually accomplished  and selfcontrolled hermits and charanas. '

' ', '(The place was) full of apsaras  in their thousands and paragons of beauty adorned with divine ornaments and garlands, and experts in lovesports.'

'It was chosen by prosperous wives of gods as a reosrt. Hosts of gods and demons were wandering, there in the hope of tasting nectar.'

' ', '(It was ) full of small floats, flocks of swans, kraunchas, sarasas cackling in the ponds, with great joy. It had stretches of vaidurya stones on the shore and shone with the radiance of the sea'

'Speeding along, the brother of Kubera (Ravana) saw palewhite, spacious aerial chariots on all sides controlled by those who had conquered the higher worlds by their penances. These chariots, decked with heavenly garlands, and ringing with divine music could fly where one desired. He saw gandharvas and apsaras as well. '

'He saw thousands of tree trunks with finesmelling resins and sandalwood trees.'

'(He saw) very fine aguru trees in the forest as well as pleasuregroves of takkola fruits, fragrant  trees of a fine variety and fragrant nutmegs.'

'(He saw) tamala flowers in bloom, pepper shrubs in clusters and hoards of pearls kept for drying on the shores.'

'He saw stretches of conches, heaps of corals and mounds of gold and silver too.'

'He went watching fascinating waterfalls, pleasing ponds, cities filled with wealth and grain, looking splendid with beautiful women and full of elephants, horses and chariots.'

'It was a veritable heaven with the plain land flooded with the backwaters of the sea and gentle breeze blowing.'

'He saw a banyan tree with its branches spread on all sides measuring a hundred ', 'yojanas, looking like a cloud and providing shelter to the sages.'

'In the past, the mighty Garuda brought an elephant and a huge tortoise and sat on a branch of this tree to feed on them. '

'Due to the weight of this best of birds, the mighty Garuda, the leafy branch at once broke down.'

'Gathered together under the great tree were great sages like vaikhanasas, mashas, marichipas, valakhilyas, ajas and dhumras.'

'Out of compassion for the (endangered) seers Garuda carried away that hundredyojanalong branch along with the elephant and the tortoise with great speed.'

'Righteous Garuda, the best among the birds, stood on one foot and ate the flesh (of elephant and tortoise) and  with the branch of the tree, destroyed the settlement of the demons. Over the destruction of the demons and deliverance of the great seers he felt immeasurable happiness.'

'Quite happy, his energy redoubled, wise Garuda made up his mind to obtain nectar.'

"Twisting and twirling the grills of the window, he broke open the room made of gems and quietly carried away the nectar from Indra's mansion."

'Ravana, the younger brother of Kubera, beheld that banyan tree called Subhadram ,which was a favoured resort of the sages bearing the ensignia of Garuda.'

'Ravana crossed over to the other side of the sea, the lord of rivers, and beheld a hermitage in a beautiful, secluded, sacred  place in the middle of the forest.'

'There he saw a demon Maricha, by name, clad in dark deerskin and bark ,with matted hair and living on restricted food.'

'When king Ravana reached there, Maricha received him  in accordance with tradition  and made worshipful offering to the king, fulfilling all his superhuman desires.'

'Maricha extended his hospitality with appropriate food and water and said with meaningful words:'

'O king  O lord of the demons  hope all is well in Lanka. What brings you here again so soon ?'

'Thus addressed by Maricha, the effulgent, eloquent Ravana replied with these words:', 'इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे पञ्चत्रिंशस्सर्गः।।', 'Thus ends the thirtyfifth sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.'

'O dear Maricha hear my words. I am distressed and you are my ultimate refuge.'

'You know that my brothers, Khara and Dusana, the strongarmed heroes, my sister Surpanakha and  the mighty cannibal Trisira, and many other heroic demons successful in hitting their targets are bonafide residents. They have been harassing the followers of righteous path (the sages) at my behest.'

'These fourteen thousand heroes, perpetrators of terrible deeds, skilled in hitting the targets had been acting according to the direction of Khara.'

'These mighty demons, living in Janasthana, eqipped with different kinds of weapons, supported and led by Khara, met Rama in an encounter.'

'With his wrath generated, Rama, without even speaking anything, used his bow and the arrows.'

'Being a human being who fought on foot, he killed fourteen thousand ferocious demons with his sharp arrows.'

'Khara, Dusana and Trisira were killed in war.The residents of Dandaka forest are rendered safe and fearless.'

"Rama, a victim of his father's anger, banished into the forest with his wife, a shortlived mortal and a calumny on the kshatriyas has killed the army of demons."

'He is a man of bad conduct, harsh, sharptonged, stupid, miserly and a slave to his senses. He is immoral and unrighteous, one who is busy harming others.'

'With no enmity whatsoever, merely because he has strength, he cut off the nose and ears of my sister and mutilated her. His wife Sita  is like the daughter of heaven. I would like to abduct her with force from Janasthana for which you should be my accomplice.'

'You are mighty. I do not care to fight even the gods when you and my brothers are by my side. Therefore, O demon, be my accomplice. (I know) you are capable of that.'

'In valour,  in war and in conceit there is no one equal to you. You know all means (of success). You are great. You are brave. You are an expert in all deceitful arts.'

'I have come to you for this purpose seeking your help. Listen to  my words on what you should do:'

"Be a wonderful golden deer dappled with silver dots and roam in front of Sita in Rama's hermitage."

'Seeing you in the form of a deer, Sita will undoubtedly ask her husband and Lakshmana to capture you. '

'Then during their absence it will be easy for me to abduct Sita in an isolated place without obstruction, like Rahu eclipsing the light of the moon.'

"Thereafter, when Rama with his soul afflicted due to his wife's abduction. I can freely, happily, successfully strike him down."

"At the mention of Rama's name, great Maricha's mouth dried up and he became concerned."

'Licking his dried up lips, as though his eyes stopped winking like those of the dead, Maricha stared at Ravana, distressed.'

"Maricha who knows of Rama's valour was frightened and depressed at heart. He revealed to Ravana with folded hands some facts for mutual benefit.", 'इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीये आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे षट् त्रिंशस्सर्गः।।', 'Thus ends the thirtysixth sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.'

'Having heard the words of Ravana, lord of the demons, wise Maricha who was also an eloquent speaker replied:'

'O king, it is always easy to find men who speak pleasing words, but it is difficult to get a speaker and a listener who use words unpleasant (to the ears) but beneficial (in life).'

"You  are fickleminded.  You have employed no spy ( who could have told you the truth about Rama's character). Rama is very brave and virtuous comparable to Indra and Varuna. Surely you are not able to know what Rama is."

'O dear may there be good to all the demons in the world. If Rama gets enraged, he will make this world demonless.'

'Hope the daughter of Janaka is not born to put an end to your life. Hope I will not face any disaster on account of Sita.'

'I hope the city of Lanka along with the (entire) race of demons will not be destroyed, with a dictator like you who is a slave to sensual pleasure.'

'A king  who is a slave to passion, who is of bad conduct, of wicked thoughts, advised in evil ways destroys himself, his kith and kin and the entire kingdom.'

'Rama, the delight of Kausalya, has not forsaken by his father. He has never crossed the limits of dharma. He is not miserly. He has no  bad conduct. He is not a slur on the kshatriyas. He does not lack in righteousness. He is not cruel nor is he engaged in doing harm to others.'

'O dear, seeing that his truthful father was going to be deceived by Kaikeyi, righteous Rama himself offered to fulfil the promise of his father and came away to the forest.'

"To satisfy the desire of Kaikeyi and to fulfil his father's word he came to Dandaka forest,  leaving the kingdom and all royal pleasures, behind."

'O my dear, Rama is not harsh nor ignorant. It is not that he has no control over the senses. It is not proper  for you to say what is false. You are illinformed.'

'Rama is dharma incarnate. He is pious. His strength is truth. He is king of all the worlds like Indra to the gods.'

'Sita is protected by the strength of her character. How do you desire to carry her away forcibly (from Rama) ? Can any one separate the radiance of the Sun from the Sun itself ?'

'You should not enter into the unquenchable fire that is  Rama,  the fire that has the  arrows (of Rama) as its flames and his sword and bow as fuel.'

'You should not give up happiness,your dear life and kingdom and come to Rama who is a variable god of death. His bow is  like on open burning mouth, and his flaming arrows are like fire. He is all anger. He is wielder of bow and arrows. He can strike the enemy army (alone).'

"Immeasurable indeed is the power of Rama to whom Sita, daughter of Janaka belongs. You are not competent to kidnap her, for she is under the refuge of Rama's bow in the forest."

'Beautiful Sita happens to be the wife of Rama who is like a lion among men. Rama ', 'has a broad chest like that of a lion. He loves Sita who is ever loyal to him, more than his life.  '

'Sita is the darling of mighty Rama. With her slender waist, she is like the leaping flames of blazing fire and it is not possible  for you to touch her.'

'O chief of the demons, why do you make this futile attempt ? The moment you are seen by Rama in war will be the last of your life.'

'If you want to enjoy your life, happiness and even the kingdom which is not easily attainable for long, do not incur the displeasure of Rama.'

'After consulting all your ministers and the righteous persons led by Vibhisana, you may take a decision. Assess the real strength and weakness, merits and demerits  of your own and of Rama. Decide what is good or bad for you and then take steps you deem proper. '

'O Ravana  I think it is not good on your part to confront the prince of Kosala in a war. Listen to my words and consider what is good for you.', 'इत्यार्षे श्री मद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे सप्तत्रिंशस्सर्गः।।', 'Thus ends the thirtyseventh sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.'

'Once I was roaming the earth, like a mountain possessing the  strength of a thousand elephants, like a dark cloud, wearing bright gold earrings and crown,holding a spear in hand, terrorising the people. I was wandering in Dandaka forest feeding on the flesh of ascetics.'

'Once I was roaming the earth, like a mountain possessing the  strength of a thousand elephants, like a dark cloud, wearing bright gold earrings and crown,holding a spear in hand, terrorising the people. I was wandering in Dandaka forest feeding on the flesh of ascetics.'

'Hence the great sage, righteous Visvamitra afraid of me, went to king Dasaratha  and said: '

"'O king Maricha has created in me a great fear. Spare the self possessed Rama to protect me while I do the sacrifice.'"

'When the great, venerable sage Visvamitra said so, the righteous king Dasaratha replied:'

"'My son Rama is only twelve. He is not experienced in the use of weapons. I shall accompany you with my army."

"'O distinguished sage with the four divisions of my army I will slay the enemies you want me to.'"

'When  the king thus responded to the sage,  he told him that none other than Rama in this world is a match for that demon.'

"'O king, you have protected even gods in wars and have been a guardian. Your deeds are very wellknown in the three worlds."

"'O scourge of foes as you wish, let your great army wait here. Even though Rama is young he is glorious, and capable of subduing the enemy. I will take him. Be blessed.'"

'Sage Visvamitra saying so took the son of the king and went back very happily to his hermitage.'

'Then Rama was initiated for the protection of sacrifices and stood on guard, stretching his wonderful bow.'

'Thereafter, handsome Rama, with eyes like lotus petals, beards ungrown, clad in a single garment with knotted hair on the head, wielding a bow, with a chain of gold, luminous with his own lustre enhanced the glory of Dandaka forest by looking like the young moon just risen.'

'Then looking like a dark cloud, wearing bright golden earrings, proud of power bestowed on me with boons, I arrived at the hermitage.'

'I entered at once and lifted my weapons. Rama saw me and unperturbed, started stringing his bow.'

"Out of my delusion I underestimated the young boy, and screaming, ran towards Visvamitra's sacrificial altar."

'Then Rama released a sharp arrow that could kill the enemy. It struck me and threw me at a distance of hundred yojanas into the sea.'

'O dear being thrown away by the speed of his dart I lost my consciousness. I was protected by Rama who did not want to kill me. '

'O dear I was thrown into the deep sea and after a long time regained consciousness and  returned to the city of Lanka.'

'That way I was spared by the young boy who was not versed in archery and who could still accomplish the task with ease.Those who accompanied me were destroyed.'

'If you pick up conflict with Rama even while being warned by me you will soon face a ', 'dreadful calamity.'

'You will bring grief and disaster into the lives of demons who are sporting in love and who are in the habit of celebrating community festivals with joy.'

'You will see the city of Lanka dotted with magnificent royal mansions embellished  with different kinds of gems ruined for the sake of Sita.'

'Even without committing any sin those pure souls because they keep company with sinners will be destroyed for the sins of others just like fishes in a pool of serpents.'

'You will see the demons who smear their limbs with sandal paste and unguents, who are adorned with excellent ornaments slain and laid on the ground for your mistakes.'

'You will see the rest of the demons with their wives gone or fleeing in all directions helplessly with none to take care of them.'

'You will undoubtedly see Lanka filled with arrows, surrounded by flames of fire and its buildings on fire.'

'O king there is no sin greater than violating the chastity of others wives, when you have married a thousand lovely women.'

'Enjoy with your wives. Protect your race, prestige, kingdom, prosperity and your own dear life.'

'If you wish to enjoy your beautiful wives and your good friends for long, do not create enmity with Rama.'

'If you violate Sita forcibly notwithstanding my friendly warning, your life will be drained by the arrows of Rama and you will reach the abode of Yama with your kith and kin, your strength depleted.', 'इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे अष्टत्रिंशस्सर्गः।', 'Thus ends the thirtyeighth sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.'

'I was somehow saved by him this way in the combat.Listen without any reply to what has taken place recently.'

'Having done so, I picked up courage and entered Dandaka forest, accompanied by the two other demons in the form of deer .'

'I wandered in Dandaka forest in the form of a huge animal with a big and strong body, a flaming red tongue and sharp teeth feeding on flesh.'

'O Ravana, assuming a very dreadful form, I wandered about sacrificial spots, sacred places, river banks, under huge trees planted at quadranglestorturing the ascetics.'

'I wandered  about the Dandaka forest slaying righteous ascetics, drinking their blood and eating their flesh.'

'While thus roaming, I harmed the wanderers of the forest. Intoxicated with their blood ', 'I used to frighten the righteous. '

'I encountered again the righteous Rama who was in the form of an ascetic, with venerable Sita and the great warrior Lakshmana.'

'Although Rama was very strong, he was living on restricted diet, engaged in the welfare of all beings. Treating him as a mere ascetic living in the forest, remembering my past hostility with him and disregarding his (fatal) blow, I ran towards him angrily, assuming the form of a sharphorned animal with an intention to kill him.'

'His mighty bow drawn, Rama released three sharp darts that came whizzing like Garuda or the wind. They could destroy the enemy.'

'All the three tightly jointed, welltargetted darts, strong as thunderbolt, and which could feed on blood came together all at once.'

"Having known Rama's prowess earlier and experienced tremendous fear, I ran away in a bewildered state as I was deceitful. The other two demons (who had accompanied me) succumbed. "

"With my escape from Rama's darts I somehow got a fresh lease of life. Now I am composed. I have started living the life of a recluse here. I have turned an ascetic."

'I see Rama in every tree, clad in bark and deerskin, wielding the bow, holding a noose in hand like the god of death.'

'O Ravana I see in my fear thousands of Ramas. The entire forest appears to me as though filled with Rama.'

'O king of the demons  I see only Rama even in solitude. When I see him in a dream  I lose my senses in a state of bewilderment.'

"O Ravana, every name beginning with the letter 'Ra', such as Ratna (gems), Ratha (chariot), etc. strike terror in me."

'I know his power.It is not proper to wage a war with him. Rama, delight of the Raghu dynasty, can slay even Bali or Namuchi.'

'Missing'

'There were many pious men in this world who practise yoga and dharma .They have been destroyed along with their retinue due to mistakes committed by others.'

'O demon   As such, I will perish due to your offence. You may do anything you deem appropriate. I will not follow you.'

'Rama is brilliant, powerful and strong. I hope he will not be the god of death for the world of demons.'

'For the sake of Surpanakha, Khara of Janasthana committed excesses and got killed by Rama who can accomplish things with ease.Tell me truly if Rama did violate anything here.'

'If you do not follow my advice given for the welfare of our kith and kin, O Ravana, you are killed today. With your relations you will succumb to his straightmoving arrows.', 'इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे एकोनचत्वारिंशस्सर्गः।।', 'Thus ends the thirtyninth sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.'

'The demon Ravana did not heed the appropriate advice of the competent Maricha just like a man wishing to die refuses medicine.'

'The king of the demons, driven by fate, replied with improper and harsh words to Maricha whose advice was salutary and beneficial to him :'

'O Maricha, the words addressed to me are not appropriate.Your advice is extremely fruitless like a seed sown in saline, barren soil.'

'It is not possible to dissuade me from my encounter with Rama who is sinful, foolish and especially an ordinary human being.'

'On hearing the casual words of a woman, (this) Rama came to the forest at once, leaving his friends, kingdom, mother and father.'

'In your very presence I will surely abduct Sita, wife of Rama who killed Khara in war, ', 'Sita whom he loves more than his life. '

'O Maricha  I have made up my mind that way. Even demons or deities including Indra cannot alter this decision of mine.'

'If I asked you the merits or demerits, the risks involved or the way out while deciding a case, you should have said what you did.'

'A wise counsellor should give advice to the king only when his opinion is sought and that too with folded hands, if he wishes his own prosperity.'

'A king should be addressed with politeness and decorum, with words not unfavourble intended for his good luck and wellbeing.'

'A king who deserves honour does not feel happy to hear even good words of advice if said in disrespectful or authoritarian way, O Maricha '

'Very powerful kings assume five forms like fire, Indra, Moon, Varuna and Yama.'

'Great kings possess heat, (of the firegod), valour (of Indra), coolness (of the Moon), command (of Varuna) and grace (of the Lord of death). Therefore kings at all stages deserve respect and reverence.'

'You do not know your rightful duty.Because of delusion and an evil mind, you want to speak only harsh words to me, a guest who has come to you.'

'O demon  O extremely valiant demon  I ask you(to do) this much now. I am not asking you whether it is good or bad or whether it is for my welfare or not.'

'You have to help me in accomplishing this great task .Hear me on the kind of work you have to do.'

'Missing'

'Transform yourself into a wonderful golden deer with silver spots and move about in front of Sita at the hermitage of Rama. After fascinating her, you may go whereever you desire.'

'Seeing the illusory golden deer, Sita, wonderstruck, will at once ask Rama to get the ', 'deer.'

"Divert Rama to a faroff place and cry, 'Alas, Sita, Alas, Lakshmana',  imitating the voice of Rama. "

'On hearing you, Lakshmana will be bewildered. Urged by Sita and out of love for Rama, Lakshmana will follow the same track as Rama. '

'When Rama and Lakshmana are away I will comfortably abduct Vaidehi like the thousandeyed Indra brought Sachi.'

'You may go wherever you want after accomplishing this task. I will give you, O demon of determination half my kingdom.'

'Go and accomplish this task. Let your path be auspicious. I will follow you on the chariot into the Dandaka forest.'

'I will deceive Rama and obtain Sita, without waging a war. With the work done, I will return to Lanka along with you.'

'O Maricha if you do not do this, I will kill you now. Or, by force make you do this work. No one who goes against the king lives in comfort.'

'Your survival is doubtful after facing Rama in combat. But your death is certain if you oppose me now. Think carefuly and do whatever is desirable for you in the present circumstances.', 'इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे चत्वारिंशस्सर्गः।।', 'Thus ends the fortieth sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.'

'At this royal command which was against his interest Maracha used harsh words to the demonking:'

'Who is that sinner who has given you this advice which will spell destruction on you, your sons, your kingdom and your ministers ?'

'Which sinner is not able to see you happy? O king by whom is this gate of death ', 'shown to you cunningly?'

'This is clear that your enemy demons are now powerless. Hence they want you to be engaged with a stronger power and be destroyed.'

'O Ravana by which mean fellow is this advice given against your welfare? Who wants you to be destroyed by your own action.'

'O Ravana the ministers should have prevented you by all means from adopting this  wrong path. Since they have not done so, they deserve to be spain.'

'Good ministrers should always prevent a lustful king from taking resourse to an evil path. Why were you not stopped, even though you deserve to be checked.'

'O Ravana  the best among the successful ministers attain piety, prosperity, pleasures and fame by the grace of the king.'

"Otherwise evrything will become useless, O Ravana  Others will suffer calamities on account of their master's vices."

'O Ravana, the best among the victorious indeed the king is at the root of righteousness and victory.Therefore, the king should be protected by all at every stage. '

'O nightwalking demon  a kingdom cannnot be governed by a king who is rude or hostile or impolite.'

'Ministers who adopt improper strategies go down along with the king just like swift horses driven by a slow charioteer on a rugged terrain.'

'Persons who walk the righteous path go down in this world along with their kith and kin due to the mistakes committed by others .'

'O Ravana, people who are ruled by a cruel and hostile king will not grow like the sheep protected by a jackal.'

'Under a rude, crooked king whose senses are not under his control the demons will surely perish.'

'I am faced with  this dreadful disaster accidentally. You will not only be in a miserable state because of your misdeeds, you will perish along with your army.'

'Rama will kill you not long after killing me.Hence even if I die in the hands of the enemy, my desire will be fulfilled.'

'Yu most understand that if I die at the very sight of Rama, you along with your relatives will perish with the abduction of Sita.'

'If you bring Sita from the hermitage with my assistance, know that none of us will surviveyou nor I, nor Lanka , nor the demons.'

'O Ravana, you do not understand this word of warning coming from your wellwisher. Men who are going to die do not heed the advice given by their friends.', 'इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे एकचत्वारिंशस्सर्गः।।', 'Thus ends the fortyfirst sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.'

'Having thus spoken to the demonking, the distressed Maricha said out of fear, Let both of us go. '

'If that warrior Rama carrying bow, arrows and sword sees me once again he will raise his weapon to kill me, and I will cease to be.'

"No one who exhibits his heroism before Rama will come back alive. To you, already hit by Yama's staff, he is another form of the same Yama."

'What can I do if you remain evilminded? O dear demon, I am going. May your path be auspicious '

'Ravana was so overwhelmed with joy to hear those words that he embraced him tightly and said:.'

'Act according to my wish. It befits your valour. You were a different demon earlier. Now you are Maricha.'

"Ascend quickly with me this chariot encrusted with gems and yoked with donkeys with devils' faces৷৷"

'You may go whereever you like after tempting Vaidehi. When the princess of Mithila  is alone, I will bring her by force.'

'Thereafter Ravana and Maricha ascended the chariot, which was like an aerial car, and quickly departed from that cluster of hermitages.'

'And likewise, they went past towns, forests, mountains, streams, states and cities.'

"Ravana, king of the demons, accompanied by Maricha, then reached Dandaka forest and saw Rama's hermitage."

"Then Ravana got off the chariot decorated with golden embellishments and, holding Maricha's hand, said:."

'O friend here is the site of the hermitage surrounded by banana plants. Quickly get to work on the purpose for which we have come.'

"Hearing Ravana's words, Maricha transformed himself into a deer and started moving at the entrance of Rama's hermitage."

'Maricha assumed the form of a wonderful and magnificent deer with his antlers studded with the most precious gems, his face dappled with luminous spots of white and  black.'

"The deer's face was like a pink lotus, his ears were like blue lotus. His neck slightly raised, his lips were like petals of blue lotus."

'His bright belly was shining like kunda flowers or the Moon or diamond. His flanks were like the golden madhuka flowers. comparable to the filaments of lotus. His hooves were like vaidurya, and his legs were slim and willshaped. '

'His tail stood up looking magnificent like a colourful rainbow. Bedecked with various gems, he shone beautiful.'

"Transformed into a most beautiful deer in a moment, Maricha brightened the beautiful forest and Rama's hermitage."

'Transfigured into a beautiful, magnificent form painted with the colours of different minerals in order to tempt Sita, Maricha roamed all around the grassland.'

'That deer with hundreds of silver spots on the body appeared enchanting and pleasing to the eyes while he wandered about nibbling the tender leaves of trees.'

"The deer went wandering about the banana groves surrounding Rama's hermitage and moved slowly towards the karnikara trees in order to catch the attention of Sita."

"That magnificent deer glittered with the colour of blue lotus on its back, wandered merrily in the vicinity of Rama's hermitage."

'The wonderful deer moved to and fro, now disappearing and now swiftly returning.'

'The deer is now sporting, now sitting on the ground, now standing at the entrance of ', 'the hermitage and now running with the herds of deer.'

'Followed by herds of deer and coming back to see Sita again and again, the deer cavorted and pranced and frisked in circles in a wonderful way.'

'Seeing the deer, other animals wandering in the forest come near and sniffing him run away in all ten directions.'

'The demon who was interested in killing wild deer touched and felt them but did not ', 'kill or feed on them in order to hide his intention.'

'In the mean time Sita who, with her auspicious looks, was busy plucking flowers drew near the trees.'

'With her bewitching eyes and beautiful face, Sita, went about plucking flowers from karnikara, ashoka and mango trees.'

'The great lady Sita, unworthy of dwelling in the forest, saw the wonderful deer decked with gems, with  spots of pearls all over the body.'

'A lady with beautiful teeth and lips, Sita saw the deer having silver and mineral coloured hair on the body. She gazed at the animal with wonder and joy and love.'

"That illusory deer saw Rama's wife and moved around wonderfully as if illuminating the forest with his radiance."

'Seeing such  an unprecedented deer decorated with different gems, Sita, daughter of Janaka, stood amazed.', 'इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे द्विचत्वारिंशस्सर्गः।।', 'Thus ends the fortysecond sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.'

'Sita while plucking flowers Sita who had fine hips, flawless beautiful limbs and pure golden complexion felt delighted to see the deer with gold and silver colours on both sides of his body. She called out to Rama and Lakshmana who were equipped with arms.'

'Sita while plucking flowers Sita who had fine hips, flawless beautiful limbs and pure golden complexion felt delighted to see the deer with gold and silver colours on both sides of his body. She called out to Rama and Lakshmana who were equipped with arms.'

'When Sita called Rama and Lakshmana, the two tigers among men, they looked around and saw the deer.'

'Seeing the deer, Lakshmana suspected him to be Maricha and said this to Rama.'

'Many kings, while on hunting expedition in the forest, have been deceitfully killed by malicious Maricha, who could assume any form at his free will.'

'O tiger among men, this deceitful demon (Maricha) has been transformed into the illusory form of a radiant deer which does not exist.'

'O Rama, lord of the world nowhere on earth does exist this kind of wonderful deer sparkling with gems. That it is a mere trick, an illusion there is no doubt.'

'Sita was too enchanted by the skin of the deer to retain her sense of discrimination. Intervening, she said to Rama joyfully with a pure smile on her face:'

'O prince O longarmed one, this deer has captivated my mind. Fetch him for  me.This  will be our playmate.'

'Here at the hermitage there are many lovely deer, yaks and antelopes wandering in herds.'

'O longarmed one, most beautiful animals like bears, antelopes and groups of monkeys and kinneras are wandering here.'

'O prince  this kind of beautiful, tame and glittering deer I have never seen before.'

'Its body glittering with different colours, speckled with gems of different kinds, is like the Moon shining and illuminating the forest.'

'Oh what a beauty, Oh what rich call  what delightful, wonderful, graceful limbs  This deer captivates my heart.'

'If this deer can be caught  alive, it will be thrilling, it will work wonders.'

'After the completion  of exile in the forest, when we are back in the kingdom, this deer will add beauty to the harem.'

'O king this deer will create amazement in Bharata, in mothersinlaw, in you and in me as well.'

'O best among men, if this great deer cannot be captured alive, I will wear its beautiful skin.'

'If this animal is killed and its golden skin is spread on a tender grass cushion, there will I like to sit.'

"This kind of request arising out of a woman's desire may sound terrible, still then the beauty of this animal's skin has produced in me a wonder."

"By his golden colour resembling the rising Sun, by  his horns with excellent gems shining like the milkyway, even Rama's mind was wonderstruck."

"On hearing Sita's words and seeing the wonderful deer, Rama was tempted by its appearance.Prompted by Sita,he joyfully said this to Lakshmana:"

'O Lakshmana, see the eagerness of Sita. Such a deer of exceptional beauty will not be found in this forest. There is no equal to this animal even in the Nandan garden of Indra, or the Chaitraratha, the garden of Kubera. Where can such an animal be found on earth?'

"The stretches of hair on the deer's body bent both in the natural order and in the opposite direction look beautiful. The spots of gold on the skin are wonderful."

'Look at his tongue stretched out of the mouth while yawning. It is glowing like flaming fire. It is like the lightning sparkling in the cloud.'

'His face is a drinking pot of emerald, the belly is a conch or a pearl. Whose mind will not be attracted by this indescribable beauty ?'

'Whose mind will not be filled with wonder on seeing this divine beauty glittering like lustrous gold and studded with a variety of gems ?'

'O Lakshmana kings who wield  bows  in hunting expeditions kill deer in the forest for  ', 'sport as well as for venison.'

'From huge forests a variety of mineral wealth consisting of gems, stones and gold are collected with great effort.'

'O Lakshmana the essence of forest wealth is mineral wealth, which helps the growth of the treasury. It is conceived mentally as in the case of Venus.'

'A materialist moves about thoughtlessly for making money. Economists call it material wealth.'



'The skins of various types of deer like Priyaki, Kadali or goats or sheep cannot be compared in softness to the skin of this deer. '

"This majestic deer and the deer flying in heaven (the deer's figure seen in the Moon called Mrgasira)  both the deer of the star in the sky and the deer of the earth are divine."

'Lakshmana, as you say, if it is the illusion of a demon, even then it should be killed by me.'

'The great sages were tortured and killed earlier by this cruel, evilminded Maricha while wandering in the forest.'

'Many kings who were great archers who set out on hunting expedition were killed by him. Therefore, this animal deserves to be killed.'

'Earlier in this forest, Vatapi used to humiliate the ascetic brahmins and to kill them by entering into their stomach like a womb killing the female mule.'

'That Vatapi after a long time, once greedily entered into the stomach of the great lustrous sage Agastya and became his food.'

'When the venerable sage Agastya got up (after eating), he observed Vatapi wishing to turn into his real form. So smiling at him, he said:'

"'O Vatapi you killed the best of brahmins living in this world, disregarding them because of your power. Hence you were digested by me.'"

'O Lakshmana just like Vatapi, this demon will not live. Whoever violates a person of my kind who is ever righteous and selfcontrolled will be killed'

'O Lakshmana, delight of the Raghu dynasty, be very alert and restrained and protect Sita. Whatever duty we have to perform depends on her protection.'

'O Lakshmana I will go quickly and either kill the deer or catch it.  Now let me go.'

'See, how Vaidehi ardently longs for the skin of this deer  I will not let the animal live, O Lakshmana '

'Keep vigil over Sita at the hermitage, O Lakshmana  I will certainly kill the speckled antelope with a single arrow, get his skin and come back quickly.'

'O Lakshmana, be vigilant in guarding Sita, suspecting danger every moment from all directions. Take the help of Jatayu, the mighty and wise bird who will be on his rounds.', 'इत्याषे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे त्रिचत्वारिंशस्सर्गः।।', 'Thus ends the fortythird sarga in Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.'

'The brilliant Rama, delight of the Raghu dynasty, thus instructed his brother and fastened a sword with a golden handle to his waist.'

'A man of indomitable prowess, he took the bow with three curves that was like an ornament to him, tied two quivers at the back and left.'

'On seeing Rama approaching him, the deer disappeared due to fear and again came within sight. With his sword and the bow, Rama chased wherever the deer ran.'

'Rama, wielder of the bow, saw that splendid animal ahead of him. Holding the bow he saw the deer running away, bewldered into the great forest looking at him again and again. The deer was getting out of the range of his arrow, while it enticed him now and then. Suspecting that he might be caught,  the deer was, as though jumping into the sky. Now it came within sight and now out of sight in the huge forest. It looked like the autumnal moon surrounded by clouds. (The clouds muffle the Moon and reveal him now and then). '

'Maricha, transformed into a deer, was seen now near, now faroff. He pulled Rama away from the hermitage through his exits and entrances.'

'Deluded by that deer, Rama got tired, perplexed and angry. Then bewidered, he waited on a grassland under a shade.'

'That demon transformed himself into a deer and, surrounded by the animals of the forest at close range, attracted his attention.'

"Seeing Rama's  intention to catch him, the deer ran away once again out of fear and disappeared in a moment."

'Resplendent Rama saw the deer coming out of a cluster of trees at a distance and determined to kill him.'

'Powerful Rama, destroyer of foes, lifted in a rage his arrow blazing like the light of  the Sun, strung it to his sturdy bow and drew it with all his force. He then aimed at the deer and released the shining  arrow created by Brahma which went hissing like a  serpent.'

'The great arrow which was like a thunderbolt first pierced into the body of Maricha who had assumed the form of a deer and then tore his heart.'

'And, hurt by the dart, Maricha roared frighteningly, leaped as high as a  palm tree  and dropped down on earth almost dead.'

'Maricha gave up his false form of the deer and before breathing his last, remembered the words of Ravana. He thought over the means through which Sita could send Lakshmana to this spot so that  Ravana would abduct her when she is alone.'

"Then Maricha realised that the appropriate time had come. In a voice similar to Rama's, he shouted loudly 'Alas Sita, Alas Lakshmana '"

"Struck in the vital part by Rama's matchless dart, Maricha gave up the form of the deer and assumed his huge body of the demon."

"Seeing that terrific demon fallen on the ground, drenched in blood, and strring his limbs, Rama thought of Lakshmana's words and reached Sita mentally (thought of her).  "

'This is an illusion created by Maricha. It happened exactly the way Lakshmana had said earlier. Maricha is now killed.'

"This demon Maricha screamed aloud saying, 'Alas, Sita, Alas, Lakshmana'. He is now dead. How would Sita react to this voice? What would be the condition of Lakshmana? While righteous Rama reflected on this, his hair stood on end."

'After killing the demon in the figure of a deer and hearing his voice, Rama was overtaken by intense fear born of despair.'

'Then Rama killed another deer, collected the venison and hastened to Janasthana.', 'इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे चतुश्चत्वारिंशस्सर्गः।', 'Thus ends the fortyfourth sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.'

"On hearing the voice in distress and recognising that it was similar to her husband's voice, Sita said to Lakshmana, 'Go and find out Rama's whereabouts'."

'I clearly heard Rama calling out in great distress. Indeed, my heart as well as my life is not in its place (restless). You ought to go and protect your brother who is crying in pain in the forest.'

'Like a bull caught by lions, your brother is seeking help caught by demons. You should run at once to your brother.'

"When he did not budge in obedience to his brother's order (to protect Sita), the daughter of Janaka in a rage said :"

'Since you, O son of Sumitra,  are not reaching out to your brother in this situation, you are an enemy to your brother in the guise of a friend৷৷'

"It is possess me that you wish Rama's death. You do not rush to him certainly because of greed for me. "

"I think Rama's adversity is welcome to you. You do not have any love towards your brother. It is for this that you stand unconcerned instead of proceeding to help your brilliant brother."

'When he for whose service you have primary come here, has met with difficulty, what is the use of your being here? What purpose you serve by staying here with me ?'

'While Sita thus spoke, flooded with tears of sorrow, frightened like a doe, Lakshmana replied :'

'O Vaidehi there is no doubt that pannagas, asuras, gandharvas, gods, men or even demons cannot defeat him.'

'O brilliant Devi  none  among gods or men, gandharvas, birds or goblins kinnaras, wild animals or dreadful demons can encounter Rama in war.'

'Rama is indestructible in war. It is not proper for you to say what you said. When he is not here I do not wish to leave you alone here in the forest.'

' ', 'He cannot be stopped by the strength of the mighty, or by Indra supported by gods or by the wellequipped armies of all the three worlds.'

'May your heart be relieved (of this fear)  Give up this grief. Your husband will soon return with the excellent deer killed.'

"Surely it is not his voice. It is contrived by some one's illusory power. It is the illusion created by that demon, like the city of the gandharvas. (which does not exist.)"

'O best of women Vaidehi  great Rama has entrusted your safty to me. I do not wish to leave you here alone.'

'O Vaidehi since the killing of Khara and the residents of Janasthana we have developed enmity with the demons.'

'These demons wander about tormenting others and spreading rumours of all kinds. ', 'You need not worry about them.'

'Addressed thus by Lakshmana, Sita got mighty angry. Her eyes turned red and she spoke harshly to truthful Lakshmana'

'O ignoble, cruel Lakshmana, you are a disgrace to your family. I think this great disaster of Rama is a pleasure to you.'

'O Lakshmana,do you speak such words seeing the disaster of Rama?  No wonder that cruel men who always move like you in disguise will thus resort to sinful action against rivals.'

' ', 'You are very wicked. You are hiding your true identity, and employed by Bharata, you are following Rama in the forest as he is alone.'

"O Lakshmana such intention of yours or even of Bharata's will not be fulfilled. I have held the hands of Rama who has eyes like the lotus petal, who has the complexion of the blue lotus. How can I prefer some other man?"

'I will undoubtedly give up my life in your presence.I will not live even for a moment on earth without Rama, O son of Sumitra '

"The selfcontrolled Lakshmana with folded palms replied to Sita's harsh, horripilating words:"

'O princess from Mithila, I do not want to use such harsh words. To me you are a deity (worthy of adoration). It is not surprising that women of the world use such undeserving words. It is their nature.'

'Women devoid dharma are fickle and inconsistent. They use sharp, piercing words. O daughter of Janaka, O princess from Videha, your words pierce my ears like redhot darts.I cannot tolerate them.'

'I speak what is just while you use harsh and unjust words. Let all beings who move in the forest bear witness.'

"Fie upon you. Like a woman of wicked nature you doubt me when I stood firm by my brother's words. You will go to ruin."

'O beautiful lady, I will go to Rama wherever he may be. Be happy. O largeeyed one, may  all the deities of the forest protect you.'

'O daughter of Janaka O princess from Videha, I see dreadful omens. I do not know whether I will see you when I am back with Rama.'

'At these words of Lakshmana Sita started crying. With eyes filled with tears she replied with harshness :'

'O Lakshmana without Rama I will drown myself in Godavari or hang myself or leap from a cliff into death.'

'I will drink deadly poison or enter fire and die, but will not touch any other man even with my feet.'

'Thus Sita cried in distress, sadly hitting her belly with both the hands, blaming Lakshmana (all the time).'

"Saumitri saw  the largeeyed, dejected Sita crying in distress.He pacified and consoled her but she did not say anything at all to her husband's brother."

"Lakshmana, brother of Rama, hurt by the harsh words of Sita, hastened with Rama's wellbeing in mind."

'The tenheaded Ravana who was in hiding assumed the guise of a wandering mendicant and approached Sita.'

'And then Ravana wearing fine orange robes, with hair knotted on the head, carrying a parasol, wearing sandals, hanging a kamandalu (waterpot), and a staff on the auspicious left shoulder walked towards Vaidehi like a mendicant.'

'Mighty Ravana approached Sita deprived of both the brothers, Like darkness encompasses the evening twilight in the absence of the Sun and the Moon.'

'The extremely cruel Ravana saw the illustrious young wife of Rama just as Ketu looks at Rohini star in the absence of the Moon.'

'Seeing the ferocious Ravana, the huge trees at Janasthana shook vidently. Even the wind ceased to blow.'

'Seeing Ravana with his bloodred eyes, the swiftflowing river Godavari slowed down out of fear.'

"The tenheaded Ravana who was waiting for Rama's absence now got it. Disguised as a mendicant he stepped toward to where Sita was."

'The evilminded Ravana in the guise of a holy man, like Saturn moves towards Chitra ', 'star, came close to Sita who was brooding over her husband.'

'Just like a well is concealed by an overgrowth of grass, Ravana guised as a holy man stood looking at illustrious Sita, the wife of Rama.'

'The wicked demon came close to that auspicious princess from Videha sitting in the cottage Her face was like the full moon. Her teeth and lips were lovely. She was clad in yellow silk. Her eyes were like lotus petals tormented by tears of grief. '



'Sita was the most lovely lady of the world shining in beauty. She was like the goddess of wealth (Laxmi) without her lotus. Ravana praised her thus:'

'Who are you with a golden complexion, clad in yellow silk, and looking like a lotuspond and wearing an auspicious lotus garland?'

"O lady with a beautiful face, with lovely thighs, are you 'hri', shyness personified? Are you the auspicious lovely Lakshmi, the  goddess of wealth? Are you the goddess of fame? Are you an apsara? Are you Bhuti, the goddess of fortune? Or are you Rati, the goddess of love moving at your free will ?"

'Your teeth are even and pointed, white and beautiful.Your eyes are large and clear and sparkling with dark pupils with a red tinge at the corner.'

'Your big hips are stout and strong, Your smooth thighs are like the trunk of an elephant, your breasts adorned with gems, are round and robust like palm fruits and drooping with heaviness with projected stiff nipples, shining and delightful, adding beauty.'

'O lady with an elegant smile, beautiful teeth, lovely  eyes you are enticing.Your slender waist can be compassed by my fist.Your hair is beautiful and your large breasts are rubbing against each other.You are capturing my mind  just as the flow of water in a river  touches its banks.'

'O beautiful lady I have not seen such a beauty earlier either among goddesses or among gandharavis, or yakshis or even among kinneris.'

'You are the most beautiful among women in the world. With all your tenderness and youth you are living in this forlorn forest. This maddens my heart.'

'It is not safe for a lady like you to reside here. Move out at once. This is only fit for the dwelling of horrible demons who can change their form at will.'

'You deserve to stroll in the terraces of palaces, in beautiful, luxurious and fragrant city gardens.'

'O beautiful, blackeyed lady, I think you deserve the best of garlands, best of food, ', 'and clothes and a suitable husband.'

'O best of women O lady with beautiful buttocks  can you be one  of the Rudras or Maruts or Vasus? To me, you appear like a goddess. '

'Neither gandharvas, nor kinnaras, nor gods move here. This is only a dwelling place for the demons. How did you come here ? '

'There are monkeys, lions, panthers, tigers, hyenas, bears, kanka birds and other wild animals here. How is it that you are not afraid of them?'

'O Charming lady how is it that although alone you are not afraid of the dreadful, swift, powerful wild animals like elephants in rut ?'

'Who are you, O auspicious lady ? Who are your people? Why are you here? From where have you come? For what reason are you going about alone in this fierce Dandaka tract, inhabited by demons?'

'Seeing Ravana, a villain in the guise of a brahmin praising her, Sita, the princess of ', 'Videha, honoured him with all hospitality.'

'She offered the handsome guest a seat first and then water for washing his feet with, and then invited him for food.'

'Sita, being a lady, was unable to doubt him since he came in the guise of a brahmin, holding a bottlegourd and a begging bowl. Without knowing his illintention she invited him in, mistaking him for a brahmin.'

'O brahmin, here is the seat for you. Feel free to sit. Here is water to wash your feet with. This is the best of food for you collected from the forest. Please partake this without hesitation.'

'Ravana was observing the princess from Mithila, wife of a king inviting him  and speaking to him in cordial manner. Looking at her, he resolved to  abduct her forcibly, inviting his own death.'

'Sita looked out for the beautiful figure of Rama who had gone to hunt the deer along with Lakshmana. Waiting eagerly for her husband, she only saw the vast stretch of green forest  but not Rama and Lakshmana.', 'इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे षट्चत्वारिंशस्सर्गः।।', 'Thus ends the fortysixth sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.'

'Then Ravana in the guise of a mendicant with crooked intention to abduct her, asked Vaidehi to tell him about herself.'

"'He is a brahmin and also a guest. If unanswered he may curse me'. Thinking this Sita thought for a moment and said:"

'O best of brahmins be pleased to know I am Sita by name, daughter of the great Janaka, king of Mithila and wife of Rama.'

'I lived in the house of the Ikshvakus for twelve years and enjoyed all kinds of pleasures meant for mortals.'

'In the thirteenth year, the king and lord Dasaratha consulted other kings and ministers to consecrate Rama.'

'Arrangements for consecration were on when queen Kaikeyi sought a boon from the king.'

'For the fulfilment of the promise made to Kaikeyi earlier by my truthful fatherin law, who, to my good luck, was the best of kings, she asked for two boons. One was banishment of my husband and second, consecration of Bharata.'

"'I shall not eat, or sleep or even drink if Rama is consecrated and I shall put an end to my life itself' (said Kaikeyi). "

'The king, my fatherinlaw, who respected her offered riches. Which she did not accept.'

'My husband who was very bold was twentyfive years and I had completed eighteen years since my birth.'

'My husband known in the world as Rama is largeeyed, longarmed, virtuous, truthful, pure and is always engaged in the welfare of all beings.'

'The brilliant king, Dasaratha, father of Rama, overcome by passion,  did not consecrate Rama in order to please Kaikeyi.'

'When my husband Rama approached his father for the consecration she said these unhesitating words:'

"'O Rama, listen, your father has ordered that this kingdom be bestowed on Bharata without any obstacles."

"'O Rama of the Kakutstha dynasty, you should live in the forest for fourteen years and save your father from falsehood'."

"My husband Rama, a man of fearlessness and firm resolution, said to Kaikeyi 'Be it so' and carried out her words."

"O brahmin this is his firm resolve and his great vow: 'One should give and never take one should speak the truth and nothing but he truth.'"

'Son to the second mother of Rama, his mighty halfbrother, by name, Lakshmana, a tiger among men and a  slayer of enemies in battle is a companion to him.'

'Lakshmana, his brother, is righteous and steadfast. Bow in hand, he followed Rama along with me, into exile.'

'Rama who is ever righteous and selfcontrolled entered the Dandaka forest with matted locks, his brother and me. '

'O best of brahmins three of us have been wandering with courage in the deep forest, dislodged from  the kingdom on account of  Kaikeyi.'

'Rest here awhile. My husband will return with plenty of meat of many kinds from the forest, killing deer, alligators and wild boars.'

'O brahmin, tell me your name, your gotra and your pedigree. And the purpose for which you are going about all alone in this Dandaka forest'

"To these words of Sita, Rama's wife, Ravana, the powerful king of demons, replied  sharp: "

'O Sita I am called Ravana, the lord of demons by whom all the worlds of demons, ', 'snakes and gods are frightened.'

'O flawless beauty of golden complexion seeing you clad in silk, I am not inclined to show any interest in my own wives.'

'You will be the chief queen among the best of women I have won in wars. Be blessed.'

'My great city  called Lanka is on the peak of a mountain surrounded by, and in the middle of, the sea.'

'O Sita, you can stroll with me in my pleasuregardens. O  beautiful lady, you will not like living in the forest (thereafter).'

'O Sita  if you become my wife, five thousand female attendants adorned with all ornaments will attend on you.'

'Thus addressed by Ravana, Janaki, a lady of blemishless limbs, got enraged and replied without caring for the demon:'

'I am devoted to Rama, my husband, who is unshakeable like a huge mountain, is comparable to lord Indra and is imperturbable like the mighty ocean.'

' ', 'I am the loyal wife of venerable Rama who is endowed with all excellences, a refuge to all like  a spreading banyan tree, and a votary of truth.'

'I am the faithful wife of the longarmed, broadchested  Rama,  a lion among men. His gait is the gait of an advancing, invincible lion.'

'I am the devoted wife of great Rama, whose face is like a fullmoon, who is the son of a king, who has conquered his senses and whose fame is widespread (on earth).'

"You are a jackal, and you want a lioness like me who is difficult to win. I am like the Sun's radiance whom you cannot even touch."

'O luckless Ravana  you want the beloved wife of Rama.You will, for sure, see golden trees. (which those close to death do).'

'You are seeking to pull the teeth from  the mouth of a hungry and powerful lion who is considered the enemy of the deer(which you are). You intend to pull the fang of a poisonous snake.'

'You are trying to carry the greatest of mountains, the Mandara, with one hand. You are wishing to go safe after drinking deadly poison (produced from the churning of the ocean).'

'You wish to violate the loving wife of Rama. You are rubbing your eyes with a needle and licking the razor with your tongue.'

"You want to assault Rama's dear wife. It is like girding a stone round the neck and trying to cross the sea.It is like intending to take the Sun and the Moon with both your hands."

'You intend to assaut the wife of Rama, who is a lady of virtuous conduct. You wish to hold blazing fire in your cloth.'

"You want to acquire Rama's worthy wife. You wish to walk on sharp ironheaded spear."

'The difference between you and Rama is the difference between a jackal and a lion in the forest, between a ditch and the sea, and between sour gruel and the best of wines.'

'The difference between you and Rama is the difference  between gold and lead, sandal and slime, an elephant and a cat of the forest.'

"The difference between you and Dasaratha's son is the difference between a crow and Garuda, a watercrane and a peacock, a vulture and a swan in the forest."

'So long Rama, equal in prowess to the thousandeyed Indra stands with bow and arrows in hand, I will not, although abducted, wither away like a diamond gulped by an insect (fly).'

'Having said thus to the wicked nightwalker Ravana, Sita, pure in thought remained  distressed.Her slender body started trembling like a banana plant becomes shaken by a violent wind.'

'Beholding Sita who was trembling, Ravana, powerful like death, started telling about himself, his clan, his strength and his deeds to instil more fear in her.', 'इत्तयार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे सप्तचत्वारिंशस्सर्गः।।', 'Thus ends the fortyseventh sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.'

'Addressed thus by Sita, Ravana, his anger roused, knitted his eyebrows with a frown on his forehead and replied to her harshly:'

' ', 'O paragon of beauty  I am the halfbrother of Kubera, born of his stepmother. I am known as the tenheaded, powerful Ravana. Be blessed '

'Just as people get scared of death, all (creatures) including gandharvas, gods, evil spirits, birds and snakes run away from me.'

'For some reason or other a duel took place between me and king Kubera. With my prowess, I defeated him in the duel. '

' ', 'Out of fear for me, Kubera is residing on the mighty mount Kailasa, leaving his own earlier prosperous place of residence.'

"O noble lady  with my valour I gained over from Kubera the aerial chariot 'Pushpaka', ", 'which can go wherever one desires and in which I move about in the sky.'

'O Princess from Mithila, seeing my angry face  even gods led by Indra take to their heels in fear.'

'Wherever I am, the Windgod blows with hesitation. So are the Sun and the Moon afraid of me. Afraid of me the Sun duly discharges his duties.'

'Wherever I stay or move about, the leaves of trees do not shake, and the waters in rivers remain still.'

"My city known as Lanka, teeming with terrific demons, is on the other side of the sea. It is  beautiful like the city of Indra's Amaravati."

' ', "The beautiful city of Lanka  shines with its pale white ramparts and golden interiors. The entrance gates are encrusted with vaidurya (cat'seye)."

'It is crowded with elephants, horses and chariots. It resounds with the music of trumpets. The trees in the delightful pleasuregardens yield fruits in all seasons. '

'O highminded princess, O Sita while living with me, you will not even think of other women.'

'O blessed lady of fine complexion, while enjoying both human and heavenly  pleasures with me there, you will not remember Rama who is a mortal of short lifespan.'

'Considering the eldest son a weakling, king Dasaratha has sent him away to the forest so that he could consecrate his dear son(Bharata).'

' ', 'O largeeyed Sita dislodged from the kingdom, Rama has lost his capacity to think. He is doing penance, assuming an ascetic role. What can he do (for you)?'

'I am lord of all the demons. You should not reject me I am here (only because I am) overcome by the arrows of the god of love.'

'O timid lady if you reject me, you will regret like Urvasi who kicked Pururava and regretted later.'

'O lady of fine complexion, Rama is a (mere) mortal. In war he is no match (even) for my finger. It is your good fortune that you have got me here. Take refuge in me.'

'Thus addressed, Sita was enraged and her eyes turned red. She replied in harsh words to the chief of the demons in that solitary place:. '

'Why do you wish to do something inauspicious by calling Lord Kubera who is worshipped by all beings your brother ?'

'O Ravana ,you are cruel and evilminded. You have no control over your senses. (And yet) you are the ruler of your breed. Surely they are going to be destroyed.'

"It may be possible (for some one) to live after abducting Indra's wife, Sachi, but it is not possible for any one to live after kidnapping the wife of Rama."

'O demon, you may live long after forcibly snatching the most beautiful Sachi, from the hands of Indra, the wielder of the thunderbolt, but after abusing a woman like me, you will not be released from death even if you drink nectar.', 'इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे अष्टचत्वारिंशस्सर्गः।।', 'Thus ends the fortyeighty sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.'

"On hearing the Sita's words, the powerful Ravana struck his palms one over the other and assumed a huge form (original figure)."

'Ravana again said to that princess from Mithila, I suppose you are too insane to disregard my strength and valour.'

'Standing in the sky, I can  lift the earth with my arms.  I can drink the oceans. I can kill even the god of death in a combat.'

'I can obstruct the Sun and shatter the earth with my sharp arrows. O mad woman I am a husband who can fulfil your desires, and can assume any form at my own free will. Look at me.'

'As Ravana exploded in anger, his ambercoloured eyes turned red like the radiance of the flaming fire, and almost as bright as the Sun.'

'Ravana, brother of Kubera, shed the gentle figure of a mendicant and assumed the form of the god of death.'

"Overcome by intense anger, Ravana's eyes reddened. The nightranger, stood armed with bow and arrows and shining with glittering gold ornaments, appeared like a black cloud."

"Ravana, chief of the demons, shed the mendicant's form and assumed his real self. Clad in red garments, his eyes turned red in anger. Looking like layers of clouds, he stood in front of Sita, a gem among women."

'\nRavana said to the princess from Mithila, whose black hair was shining, who was luminous like the Sun and was clad in the best of clothes and ornaments.'

'O beautiful lady  if you desire a husband who is famous in the three worlds, take refuge in me. I am fit to be your husband.'

'I am your praiseworthy husband. I will not cause any unpleasantness to you at any time. Abandon on your inclination towards, a (mere) mortal. Divert your love to me.'

'O stupid woman you think you are very wise. What is there in Rama so that you are attached to him ? He has left the kingdom and his kith and kin due to the words of a woman. He has not accomplished anything (in life). He has a limited life span and now lives in this forest haunted by wild animals.'

'Just as Budha (planet Mercury) catches Rohini (a cluster of five stars) in the sky, the evilminded, infatuated Ravana advanced towards the pitiable, pleasing Sita and caught hold of her.'

'Ravana seized with his left hand the lotuseyed Sita by the hair and lifted her by the thighs with his right hand.'

'The sylvan deities fled out of fear on seeing the dreadful appearance of Ravana who had sharp teeth and mighty arms. He looked like a mountain, a veritable god of death.'

'There arrived the great  golden chariot of Ravana, illusive and wonderful, harnessed with donkeys and braying like donkeys.'

'Reproaching the princess from Videha loudly and harshly, Ravana took her on his lap and put her on the chariot.'

'Seized by Ravana, illustrious Sita screamed aloud Alas, Rama. for one who was far away in the forest.'

'Passionate Ravana took hold of Sita who was not willing and was writhing in pain. He seized her  like (an eagle carrying away) a serpent queen and flew up.'

'While Sita was being carried off in the sky by the king of demons,   she screamed a lot in agony and anxiety like a mad woman in a bewildered state:'

'Alas, O longarmed Lakshmana, you who used to entertain your brother do not know that I am being carried away by this ruthless demon.'

'O Rama, you have given up your life, pleasure and treasure for the sake of righteousness. Do you not see me carried off by an unrighteous fellow ?'

' ', 'O scorcher of enemies you are the chastiser of the haughty. Why do you not punish such a sinner like Ravana.'

'The effect of arrogant action cannot be seen right away. Just as the crop yields results only after ripening, in the same way it takes time. Time acts as a supporting factor.'

'Time has taken a toll of your senses. This has made you do what you have done. A great calamity is awaiting you in the hands of Rama. It will end your life.'

'Alas, the lawful wife of the glorious and righteous Rama is being abducted now. Let ', 'Kaikeyi along with her relations be happy with her desire fulfilled.'

'O karnikar trees in full bloom in Janasthana, tell Rama quickly that Ravana is kidnapping Sita.'

'I salute to Malyavan and  Prasravana mountains. Tell Rama at once that Ravana is carrying away Sita.'

'O river Godavari abounding in swans and cranes, my salutations to you  Tell Rama immediately that Ravana is taking away Sita.'

'I offer my salutations to different deities residing in this forest abounding in trees of many kinds. Tell my husband about me that I am being whisked away.'

'I seek refuge in all those living beings as well as herds of animals and birds in the forest.'

'Tell Rama that his dear wife Sita whom he loves more than his life is abducted helplessly.'

'If he knows that I am abducted by Yama, the god of death, that mighty, longarmed hero will save me even from there by virtue of his valour.'

'When the griefstricken, largeeyed Sita was lamenting piteously, she saw the vulture (Jatayu) seated on a tree.'

' ', 'The heavyhipped Sita felt frightened in the grip of Ravana. When she saw Jatayu she screamed, shaken by sorrow:'

'O Jatayu, see me now being carried away by the sinful king of demons in this pitiable condition as though I am an orphan.'

'This nightranger is equipped with weapons. Cruel, strong and evilminded, he has won wars. You cannot stop him.'

'O Jatayu narrate to Rama and Lakshmana the exact facts of my abduction and all the details without any omission.', 'इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे एकोनपञ्चाशस्सर्गः।।', 'Thus ends the fortyninth sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.'

'While reposing, Jatayu heard the cry and at once looked up and saw Ravana and Vaidehi.'

'Glorious Jatayu, the best among the birds, looked like the peak of a mountain.', 'His beak was sharp. His words were auspious. He spoke from the top of the tree:'

' ', 'O tenheaded Ravana, I am Jatayu, king of vultures. I am mighty. An eternal follower, of dharma, I am an adherent to truth.'

"Rama, Dasaratha's son, is the king of the entire world. He is equal to Indra and Varuna. He is ever engaged in the welfare of the entire world."

'The lady you want to abduct from here is the famous Sita, the lawful wife of Rama, the lord of the world.'

"How can a king who adheres to righteousness outrage another's wife ? O powerful one, a king's wife in particular should be protected."

"Refrain yourself from the vile thought of violating other's wives. Wise men do not adopt what is censured by others. Just like one's own, the wise should protect other's wives."

"O son of Paulastya learned men determine the path of dharma artha and kama,  following a king's conduct even if  they are not declared in sastras."

'A king is the best repository of rigteousness, material wealth and pleasures. The king is the root of dharma, virtue and sin.'

'O best of demons  by nature you are sinful, and fickleminded. You do all forbidden acts. Otherwise,how could you get this wealth, like the celestial chariot?'

'Indeed, it is not possible to erase the nature of any one, whatever it be. Prosperity does not rest for long in the house of the evilminded.'

' ', 'Powerful and righteous Rama has not offended you, your kingdom or your city. Why do you offend him?'

'On account of Surpanakha, Khara trespassed into Janasthana and got killed by Rama, without much effort. Tell me truly, what transgression (of dharma) did he commit for which you are stealing away the wife of Rama who is the lord of this world?.'

'Leave Vaidehi at once lest with her fierce looks you should be burnt down like demon Vrtra by the thunderbolt of Indra.'

'You are not aware that you are tying a venomous snake with the skirt of your cloth. worn by you. You are not able to see the noose of death tightened around your neck.'

'O gentle Ravana one should carry that much of weight which does not tire him. One should eat only that wholesome food which can be easily digested. '

' ', 'Who will do such a deed which cannot beget dharma, fame or glory in the world? Who will do such deeds that bring only exhaustion to the body? '

'Sixty thousand years ago I was born, O Ravana  Since then I have ruled justly my hereditary kingdom.'

'I am old, you are young, wielding a bow and arrows, with shield to protect and chariot to ride. Even then I will not let you go safe with Vaidehi kidnapped.'

'You cannot carry Vaidehi by force within my very sight just as the everlasting revelations of the Vedas cannot be robbed by mere logic of reason.'

'O Ravana, if you are brave, fight with me. In a moment, you will be killed like Khara and lie down on the ground.'

'Clad in bark garments, Rama, who has often slain demons in the past will soon kill you in war.'

' ', 'What can I do? O mean fellow the two princes have gone far away.You will soon be destroyed out of fear for them. There is no doubt.'

'I will not let you take away the auspicious, lotuseyed Sita, the dear consort of Rama as long as I am alive.'

'I should do this important work of those great souls, Rama and Dasaratha, even if it claims my life.'

'O ten headed Ravana stay, stay for a while. O demon  as long as I am alive I will treat you with the hospitality of war. You will be pulled down from this best of the chariots like a ripe fruit drops from the stalk.', 'इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे पञ्चाशस्सर्गः।।', 'Thus ends the fiftieth sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.'

"Ravana's twenty eyes glowed like fire in anger after Jatayu thus rightly said."

'As the bright gold earrings of the intolerant king of demons glittered, his eyes turned red in rage and he pounced upon Jatayu, the lord of birds.'

'The clash between them was tumultuous and it appeared like the clash of two pieces of clouds in the sky raised by stormy winds.'

'The duel between Ravana and Jatayu looked as though it was a fight between two huge winged mountains of Malyavan range. '

'Then the mighty Ravana rained sharp, dreadful shafts, spears and Vikarnis at Jatayu,  king of vultures.'

'Jatayu, lord of the birds, faced the arrows and other weapons showered  by Ravana.'

'The mighty, virtuous vulture with his sharp claws wounded many parts of the body of Ravana.'

'Ravana in a rage took ten dreadful darts (looking) like the staff of death with a desire to crush the enemy.'

' ', 'The mighty Ravana fully released his dreadful, sharp arrows that went straight and pierced the vulture. '

"Seeing Sita, daughter of Janaka, on the demon's chariot with eyes full of tears, Jatayu without minding the arrows renewed his attack."

'The glorious lord of birds crushed with his feet the bow and arrow of Ravana with pearls and gems encrusted.'

'Overcome with anger, Ravana took another bow and rained (on him) hundreds and thousands of arrows.'

'Jatayu, shot with arrows on all sides in the combat, shone like the bird that returned to its nest.'

'Powerful Jatayu scattered the shower of arrows with his wings and broke down the great bow with his claws.'

'Mighty Jatayu, lord of the birds, shattered with his wings the armour of Ravana that was glowing like fire.'

'Powerful Jatayu killed in the combat, the splendid, swiftmoving, devilfaced asses with  golden shields yoked to the chariot.'

' ', 'Then he(Jatayu) broke down the great chariot(of Ravana) glowing like fire, glittering with gold and gems, made of three bamboo reeds, and capable of flying wherever the rider willed.'

'Jatayu violently pulled down the parasol shining like the full moon and the fans of the chariot along with the demons holding them.'

'Again the glorious, powerful king of birds swiftly shattered the huge head of the charioteer with his beak.'

'With the bow broken, the chariot destroyed, asses (drawing the chariot) and the charioteer dead,  Ravana fell down on the ground holding Vaidehi on his lap.'

'Seeing Ravana fallen on the ground with his broken chariot, all beings honoured the king of the birds, saying, Well done Well done'

' ', 'Seeing the lord of the flocks of birds exhausted due to age still fighting, Ravana felt glad. He flew back into the sky taking Sita, princess of Mithila, with him.'

"Seeing Sita, Janaka's daughter, happily carried away into the sky by Ravana on his lap. Jatayu, the mighty king of vultures chased him, and obstructing his path said :"

'Foolish Ravana, you are kidnapping this lady, wife of Rama, whose arrows can hit like a thunderbolt. This will lead to the destruction of all demons.'

'You are drinking poison along with all your friends, relatives, ministers, the army and  your allies. like a thirsty man drinks water.'

'Fools who do not know the consequences of their action perish soon. Similarly you are going to die soon.'

'You are bound by the noose of death like a fish holding on to the bait of the fishing hook. Where can you go now?'

'O Ravana  know that Rama and Lakshmana, the Kakutsthas, are invincible. They will not forgive the asssault you have made on their hermitage.'

'Your cowardly action will be condemned by the whole world. The path you have chosen is the path of a thief and not of a hero.'

' ', 'O Ravana if you are courageous, tarry awhile and fight with me. Like your brother Khara, you will lie on the ground dead.'

'You have resorted to unrighteous action like a dying man. This will spell your destruction.'

'If the consequences of an action be sin, who will do it ? Even the selfborn lord of the world may not.'

'Brave Jatayu having thus said these cautious words to the demon dashed against his back again and again.'

'Thereafter, seizing Ravana, Jatayu ascended on his back and pierced his body all over with his sharp claws just as a rider goads an unruly elephant.'

'Jatayu who had  his claws, wings and beak as the only weapons  pierced and pricked  Ravana all over with his nails by pressing his beak on his back and pulled out his hair.'

'Thus tormented again and again by the king of vultures, Ravana shook with anger, his lips quivering.'

'Losing his senses, with rage, Ravana held Vaidehi (Sita) with his left arm and hit Jatayu with his palm.'

'Then Jatayu, lord of the birds, subduer of enemies, overpowered Ravana and dismembered his ten left arms with his beak.'

'As the left arms were cut off, there came out from them all the ten arms instantaneously like serpents emitting poisonous flames from anthills'

'Then the tenheaded Ravana left Sita and attacked Jatayu with his fists and feet out of anger.'

'Between the warriors of unequal valour, Ravana and Jatayu, the chief of the demons and the foremost of the birds, the fight took place for a moment.'

"Ravana lifted his sword and cut off both the wings and feet of Jatayu who was fighting relentlessly (for Rama's sake)."

'(Seriously) wounded and almost dead,the vulture fell down on the ground all at once, when his wings were chipped by the demon of terrible deeds.'

'Sita, princess of Videha, saw the wounded Jatayu fallen on the ground drenched in blood. Grieving, she ran towards him as if he was her relative.'

'Lord of Lanka saw that very bold Jatayu of dark blue colour of the cloud, fair chest, fallen on the ground, looking like the forest fire that had been put out.'

"Sita, daughter of Janaka, whose face was radiant like the Moon once again embraced  Jatayu, the winged warrior, fallen on the ground, crushed by Ravana's onslaught and wept.", 'इतयार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे एकपञ्चाशस्सर्गः।।', 'Thus ends the fiftyfirst sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.'

'Sita,whose face was like the lord of the stars (Moon), saw Jatayu, king of birds, struck down by Ravana, and lamented in extreme grif :'

'People, for sure, foresee weal and woe in life from auspicious symptoms and ominous sounds.'

'O Rama you are, indeed, unaware of the great disaster that has befallen you. All the animals and birds are running for my sake to tell you about me, O scion  of the ', 'Kakutsthas. '

"'This bird that came forward to save me is hit by the sinner(Ravana) and lies down on the ground, as ill luck would have it."

"Terribly frightened, the beautiful lady (Sita) cried bitterly, 'O Rama, O Lakshmana, save me', as if they were close by and were listening to her."

'Ravana, king of the demons, ran towards Sita who was weeping like an orphan with her garlands and ornaments crushed.'

"Separated from Rama in the forest, Sita hugged huge trees, running round and round like a creeper coiled, crying loudly, 'Rama, O Rama' . The king of the demons, like Yama, caught hold of her hair only to invite his death, all the time saying, Leave it, Leave it  (Leave the tree)."

'While Sita was being assaulted, the earth with the animate and the inanimate crossed all limits of moral law and became enveloped in blinding darkness. The wind  ceased to blow and the Sun, to shine.'

"Brahma, the glorious Grandfather, saw with his divine eyes, Sita in a desperate state caught by the enemy and said, 'The task is accomplished."

'All the great seers residing in Dandaka forest felt both happy and sad, happy because the destruction of Ravana is at hand and sad because Sita was in distress.'

"While Sita was crying, 'O Rama, O Lakshmana', Ravana, lord of the demons, carried her back into the sky."

'SIta who had put on pure gold ornaments on her body and who was clad in yellow silk  shone like lightning.'

'Ravana was shining all the more with(her) yellow clothes blowing in the air, and looked like a mountain shining with fire burning around.'

'The red lotus petals worn by the most auspicious Sita, princess of Videha, were showered on Ravana.'

'As the goldencoloured garment worn by Sita blew in the wind, it looked like a coppercoloured cloud illumined by the evening Sun in the sky.'

"Sita's face with her beautiful nose on Ravana's lap and not on Rama's, shone no more like a lotus without its stalk."

"Sita's face looked beautiful with her smooth forehead, shining hair and spotless complexion like the inside of a lotus, with clean, white, shining teeth, a nice nose and lovely red lips. She was continuously weeping and wiping her tears. Her face which was pleasing like the Moon on the lap of Ravana appeared as though the Moon was rising through dark clouds."

"Shaken up by the demon and deprived of Rama's company, Sita's beautiful face looked like the Moon during daytime without any glow."

'Goldencomplexioned Sita, princess of Mithila, held by the darkcoloured king of the demons, shone like a girdle resting on a dark blue sapphire.'

'Bright like a golden lotus, adorned with gold ornaments, Sita, the daughter of Janaka, held by Ravana, looked like a streak of lightning shining bright in a dark cloud.'

'The lord of the demons by the side of Sita, princess of Videha with her jingling ornaments looked like the darkblue raincloud with its lightning and thunder.'

'As Sita was being carried away, the shower of flowers dropped from her head and scattered on the earth.'

'The shower of flowers that fell flew towards the tenheaded Ravana again in the swirling motion (of the chariot).'

'The shower of flowers that dropped went round towards Ravana, brother of Vaisravana, like the bright garland of stars move towards mount Meru.'

'The gemstudded anklet of Sita, looking like an orb of lightning, dropped with a gentle sound.'

'With her golden girdle, Sita whose complexion resembled tender leaves looked like a golden chain to bind an elephant with. (Here Ravana is the elephant).'

'The younger brother of Vaisravana (Ravana), like a massive comet, carried Sita, who was glowing in the radiance of her own beauty, and entered the sky.'

'Like the dim stars falling from the sky, her ornaments, bright as flame, scattered on the groundtinkling.'

"Sita's necklace shining like the bright Moon slipped from between her breasts like the river Ganga falling down from the sky."

"The trees filled with birds of all kinds, shaken at the top by stormy winds seemed to be saying to Sita, 'Be not afraid'."

'Lotusponds with withering lotuses and with disturbed aquatic life like fishes in fright were as if grieving for Sita as one would grieve for a companion who is unable to breathe.'

"Then the lions, tigers, deer and birds gathered together in anger (also anguish) and ran after Sita's shadow."

'The  mountains were  shedding tears in the form of waterfalls, and  crying with hands lifted up in the form of peaks, while Sita was being carried away.'

'Seeing Sita abducted, the glorious Sun looked lustreless and distraught. He developed a pale white disk around him.'

"When Rama's consort, the princess of Videha, is being carried away by Ravana, how can there be rightousness or truth or uprightness or compassion for men? Thus bewailed all beings in groups."

'The young deer full of fear and distress looked again and again with eyes blurred with tears at the direction in which Sita went. And wept.'

"The  sylvan deities shivered, seeing Sita's grief and cried aloud."

'The ten headed Ravana abducted Sita who was calling out, O Rama, O Lakshmana with her sweet voice, weeping , looking down on the earth her hair dishevelled and auspicious, (vermilion) mark on the forehead erased. Ravana abducted this highminded Sita for his own destruction.'

'Then Sita  whose teeth were  beautiful and smile, sweet was distanced from her kins, and, unable to see both Rama and Lakshmana, grew pale in intense fear.', 'इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे द्विपञ्चाशस्सर्गः।।', 'Thus ends the fiftysecond sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.'

'Sita, daughter of Janaka, princess of Mithila felt miserable, looking at Ravana taking off and got very  much agitated out of fear.'

'While being carried away, Sita wept piteously and her eyes went red with tears of anger and grief. Looking at the frightening eyes of the king of the demons, she said these words :'

'O mean Ravana, are you not ashamed of kidnapping me when I was separated (from my husband)?'

'O wicked fellow, with an intention to abduct me you enticed my husband to a distance deceitfully in the form of a deer.'

'This Jatayu, an old friend of my fatherinlaw tried to protect me but he too has fallen a prey.'

'O lowly demon, you have, indeed, shown your heroism  (in killing this old vulture). ', 'You have not won me in a battle declared by you.'

"O lowly fellow how is it that you are not ashamed of commiting such a despicable act  abducting another's wife when she is alone ? "

'You consider yourself to be brave after committing such a cruel, despicable and unrighteous act for which people of the world will condemn you.'

'Fie upon your heroism and strength about which you boasted. Fie upon your character that would bring calumny to the race and the world. I condemn such behaviour of yours.'

'Tarry a little, you will not go back with life. What can be done now since you are running away so swiftly?'

'If you come within sight of these two princes, it will not be possible for you to live for a moment even if you are with your entire army.'

'Just as a bird cannot bear the touch of forest fire, you will not be able to endure the mere touch of arrows of the two heroes indeed.'

'O Ravana be good and do whatever is beneficial to you. It is proper for you to release me. If you do not, enraged over my assault, my husband along with his brother, will bring about your destruction.'

'O vile creature, the effort you are making to abduct me forcibly will be fruitless.'

'I will not be eager to hold on to my life for long to live at the mercy of the enemy without being able to see my godlike husband.'

'At the time of death, mortals behave very differently. They act contrary to their own welfare. Likewise you are not able to foresee what is beneficial and good for you.'

'Those who wish to die, do not like anything salutary. I see the noose of death wound round your neck now.'

'O tenheaded Ravana, since you do not fear the source of fear, evidently you see golden trees. (a symptom of death).'

'O Ravana, you see the dreadful river Vaitarani with torrents of blood flowing and frightening forest of trees with swords as leaves.'

'You will see a log of salmali tree with bright golden flowers and excellent vaidurya stone with pointed iron thorns.'

'You are pitiless. You will not be able to survive for long after deceiving such noble Rama just as man cannot survive after drinking poison.'

'O Ravana you are bound by the inevitable noose of death. Where shall you get away from great Rama, my husband to obtain peace.'

'Rama has killed fourteen thousand demons alone without his brother within a moment. He is a strong warrior and wellversed in the use of all kinds of weapons. You have stolen his loving wife. How can he live without killing you.'

"Sita, daughter of Videha, full of sorrow and fear under Ravana's grip uttered these partly harsh and partly piteous wordsweeping."

'Sinful Ravana carried away the beautiful princess trembling with great fear, struggling helplessly, crying pathetically and pleading in many mournful ways.', 'इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे त्रिपञ्चाशस्सर्गः।।', 'Thus ends the fiftythird sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.'

'While Sita was being kidnapped, she saw no one to protect her. Only five great monkeys stood on the top of a mountain.'

'Largeeyed, bright and beautiful Sita dropped her upper silk garment shining like gold and auspicious ornaments in their midst with a hope they may report this  to Rama.'

'In his excitement Ravana failed to notice when Sita dropped down that garment along with ornaments in their midst.'

'The best among the tawneyeyed monkeys gazed, without blinking, at the  largeeyed Sita lamenting.'

'Ravana crossed the lake Pampa and flew towards the city of Lanka carrying with him lamenting daughter of Videha.'

'Delighted Ravana, carried off Sita, the very embodiment of his death, like one carrying a highly poisonous sharpfanged female snake on his lap.'

'Like an arrow released from the bow, Ravana went through the sky, at once crossing forests, rivers mountains and tanks.'

'Ravana soon crossed the refuge of rivers, the abode of Varuna, god of the sea, inexhaustible ocean, and the home for whales and crocodiles.'

'While Sita, princess of Videha was being carried away, the ocean, abode of Varuna  ', 'got bewildered, waves rolled back, the movement of big serpents and fishes stopped. '

'The charanas and siddhas moving in the sky said, O tenheaded Ravana this is your  end .'

'Ravana entered the city of Lanka holding Sita who was tossing from side to side and who was the very embodiment of his death.'

'Ravana went through the well laidout roads of the city of Lanka and through the well many guarded halls of the palace and entered the inner apartment.'

'Sita, with her dark eye lashes and lost in utter sorrow was kept in the harem by Ravana, like demon Maya kept Mayamayi.'

"Ravana ordered the female goblins of fearful appearance,'Let no outsider whether man or woman, see her, without my permission'."

'Pearls, gems or gold, clothes or ornaments, whatever she desires, be made available to her without any hesitation.'

'Whoever utters any unpleasant words knowingly or unknowingly to Sita, princess of Videha is not worthy to survive (must be killed).'

'The courageous lord of the demons, having said so to the demonesses, came out of the inner apartment. While contemplating the future course of action, he saw eight powerful, carnivorous demons. '

'The mighty Ravana, deluded by the boons, praised the strength and valour of the demons and said :'

'Armed with different weapons, proceed at once to Janasthana where Khara lived and died.'

'Go and there in the desolate Janasthana where all demons had been killed, leaving all your apprehensions and relying on your strength and vigour.'

"I had stationed a great army at Janasthana, who were all killed along with Khara and Dusana by Rama's arrows."

'My anger engineered by my intolerance has crossed the limits of my patience. It has created in me a terrific enmity against Rama.'

'I want to take revenge on my foe. I shall not sleep until I kill him in a combat.'

'I will be happy only after killing the destroyer of Khara and Dusana, just as a poor man feels happy only on acquiring wealth.'

'While dwelling at Janasthana, all of you should collect exact information about the activities of Rama.'

'All of you, O nightrangers, should be on the alert there and it should be always your duty to try to kill Rama.'

'I have seen your strength on many war fronts. That is why you have been assigned this  duty at Janasthana.'

'The eight demons were glad to hear the pleasing and meaningful words of Ravana. They offered him salutations and left Lanka in the direction of Janasthana without being seen by any one.'

'Then the demon Ravana felt greatly happy for getting Sita, princess of Mithila, without knowing in his delusion that he had created the bitterest enmity with Rama.', 'इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वामलीकीये आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे चतुःपञ्चाशस्सर्गः।।', 'Thus ends the fiftyfourth sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.'

'After ordering the eight most fierce  and powerful demons, Ravana had a sense of accomplishment within himself because of his perverse intellect. '

'Thinking about Vaidehi and hit by the arrows of Cupid (the god of love). Ravana hastened to see Sita and entered the beautiful home. '

'Ravana, lord of the demons, entered his residence and saw Sita full of grief in the midst of the demonesses.'

'The demon Ravana forcibly took Sita, her face full of tears, to show her his heavenlike home. Inflicted with grief she looked wretched. She resembled a female deer hounded out of the herd. With her head bent in grief, she looked pathetic like one not under her control, like a boat sinking under the sea driven by the wind.'

'His home was a complex of palaces and mansions served by thousands of women. It was an abode of different flocks of birds. It had captivating pillars studded with gold, crystals, silver, diamonds and vaiduryas. It resounded with wonderful sounds of drums. Its golden entrances were glittering.'

'He ascended the wonderful golden staircase taking Sita along with him.Beautiful looked the rows of mansions with silver and ivory windows and golden trellis. '

'The tenheaded Ravana showed Sita, the princess from Mithila the floors with wonderful crystals.'

'Ravana showed Sita who was overwhelmed with sorrow, stepwells surrrounded by various trees and tanks.'

'The sinful Ravana showed Sita, princess of Videha, the best of all his mansions in order to allure her, saying:'

'O Sita, leaving aside children and the aged, I am the lord of crores of nightrangers in addition to ten crore demons and twentytwo crore terrorists.'

'For me alone there are a thousand attendants.The  administration of the kingdom and all my subjects will be under your control. O largeeyed Sita you are dearer to me than my life.'

'O Sita dear  be my chief queen among the many thousands of women I have married.'

'Do not think otherwise. Be good and accept my request. I am consumed by thoughts of you. You should be gracious to me.'

'This Lanka extending to a hundred yojanas and surrounded by the sea is vulnerable to neither demons nor gods including Indra.'

'I do not see any one equal to me in valour among gods, or yakshas or gandharvas or birds.'

'Of what use is Rama who has lost his kingdom, who is depressed and leads an ', 'ascetic life and who is a shortlived, lacklustre human being.'

'O Sita take refuge only in me. I am a befitting husband to you. O timid one youth is impermanent. Enjoy (your life) with me while it lasts.'

'O lovely Sita, give up the thought of seeing Rama. Where does he possess the power to reach this place even on the mental plane ?'

'It is not possible to bind  the wind blowing at high speed in the sky. Similarly it is not possible to catch the brilliant glow of flaming fire.'

'O lovely lady, I do not see any one in these three worlds who can, by his valour, take you away from me guarded by my arms.'

'Rule this vast kingdom of Lanka. People like me, even gods and all beings, mobile and immobile, will be at your beck and call.'

'Drenched with the waters of consecration, entertain me. The effect of the bad deeds done in the past are over with your dwelling in the forest. Now enjoy the fruits  of your  ', 'good and righteous deeds here with me.'

'O princess from Mithila, put on all garlands of wonderful fragrance and finest of jewels here with me. '

'O finehipped lady, I won by my strength from my brother Vaisravana (Kubera) an aerial chariot called Pushpaka shining with the radiance of the Sun. '

'O Sita that excellent chariot is big and beautiful. Where on you can roam happily along with me.'

'O heavyhipped lady your face which is a clean lotus pleasing to the eye has lost its shine, stricken with grief.'

'As Ravana went on speaking thus, Sita covered her beautiful, moonlike face with the edge of her garment and stood shedding tears.'

'While Sita was lost in thought, feeling ill at lase, looking wretched with her beauty dulled by her anxiety, the sinful lord of the demons continued :'

'O Sita you need not feel shamed that it is a violation of righteous conduct. Take it as godsend which has the approval of sages.'

'I am bowing down, pressing my heads at your shining feet. I am at your mercy. Grant me your favourI will remain your slave and remain ever under your control.'

'My throat has dried up. I have spoken these words in a forlorn state. Ravana has never bowed down to a woman in obeisance.'

'Having said this to the daughter of Janaka, the tenheaded Ravana who had fallen under the control of Yama, lord of death, misconceived that she had become his own.', 'इतयार्ष श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे पञ्चपञ्चाशस्सर्गः।।', 'Thus ends the fiftyfifth sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.'

'Thus addressed by Ravana, Sita, immersed in deep sorrow and unafraid of him, placed  a blade of grass between her and him (intending not to speak to him  straight) and replied:'

'Rama is a son of  the renowned king Dasaratha, who was a firm ambankment (protector) of righteousness and was true to his promise. '

'The longarmed, largeeyed Rama is famous in all the three worlds. He is my husband, a righteous soul and a god to all.'

"The brilliant Rama of the Ikshvaku dynasty with the lion's shoulders will come with his brother Lakshmana and take away your life."

'Had you abducted me forcibly in his presence, you would have been lying down dead just as Khara in Janasthana.'

'Those dreadful, mighty demons you have described are ineffective in his presence just like the serpents who with their venom are ineffective  in the presence of  Suparna (Garuda).'

' ', 'The goldtipped arrows released from his bowstring will shatter your body like the waves erode the banks of river Ganga.'

'O Ravana, even if you stand invulnerable to gods and demons, you will not come out alive in the combat with Rama with whom you have earned great enmity.'

'Powerful Rama will put an end to whatever little life you are left with. Just as a beast ', 'tied to a sacrificial post, you will not  survive.'

'O demon, you will be completely consumed if Rama looks at you with eyes burning in anger.'

'He who can bring down the Moon to the earth from the sky or even dash it down, he who can drain the sea dry will definitely release me from here.'

'Your life is coming to an end. Your fortunes will wane, your strength will be sapped. Your senses will be dissipated. By your deeds Lanka will attain widowhood.'

'This evil deed(of abduction) will not yield happy results.You have brought me from my husband from the forest without any forethought.'

'My effulgent, valiant husband armed with divine power resides fearlessly in the desolate Dandaka.'

'He will remove your pride, your power, your valour and haughtiness from your limbs with a shower of arrows in the fight.'

'When destruction draws near, people being prompted by time start commiting blunders in their deeds.'

'You vilest of demons, since you have assaulted me, the time of your death and destruction of all demons and of all women in the harem has drawn near.'

'The sacrificial altar adorned with ladles and vessels and sanctified by the sacred mantras recited by brahmins cannot be defiled by a chandala (man of lowest caste). '

'O lowly demon  similarly I am a chaste woman and wife of the ever righteous Rama who cannot be defiled by a sinner like you.'

'How can a female swan ever sporting in lotusponds in the company of a royal swan look at the watercrow resting on a grassy land?'

'O demon  this body has (now) no consciousness. You may bind it or bury it. I do not think that this body or even this life need to be protected. But at no cost can I make this an object of censure on earth (must not be branded an unchaste woman).'

'Having uttered these very harsh words out of anger, the daughter of Videha, the princess from Mithila spoke no more.'

'Having heard such harsh, horripilating words from Sita, Ravana replied in a way designed to create fear in her:'

'O comely princess from Mithila, O lady with a sweet smile listen to my words. If you do not accept my hand in the course of twelve months, the cooks will cut you off into small bits for the (my) breakfast.'

'Enraged Ravana, who used to make enemies wail, turned to the demonesses and said these words.'

'Addressing the flesheating, blooddrinking, loathsome and fearful demonesses Ravana said, Humble her pride at once.'

'No sooner had Ravana said it than the dreadful demonesses offered obeisance to him with folded hands and surrounded Sita.'

'Stamping his feet and shaking the ground as if tearing the earth, Ravana said to those fiercelooking demonesses:'

'Let this Sita be led into the Asoka grove. There sit round her and protect her in secret (her presence there should not be made public).'

'There you all bring her under control through forcing and cajoling as one would do to tame a wild sheelephant.'

'Thus instructed by Ravana, the demonesses took Sita into the Asoka grove, which was full of perenmal fruits and flowers of different kinds, where trees yielded fruits of all seasons and birds were always cheerful.'

'Sita, daughter of Janaka, engulfed in grief found herself like a doe under the control of tigresses.'

'Sita, daughter of Janaka, immersed in deep grief knew no peace just like a doe caught in a snare.'

'Sita had no peace as she was threatened excessively by those women of deformed  looks. Remembering her beloved husband who was also her god, and overtaken by fear and grief , she fell unconscious.', 'इतयार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे षटपञ्चाशस्सर्गः।।', 'Thus ends the fiftysixth sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.'

'Rama killed Maricha, the demon assuming the form of the deer as per his will and swiftly took the return path.'

'While Rama was hasting to see Sita, he heard from behind the ghastly howl of a jackal.'

'Rama knew it was the horrible, horripilating cry of a jackal which made him apprehensive . It made him think.'

"'The way the jackal is howling appears ominous. May Sita be safe without being eaten up by demons "

"'If  Lakshmana listens to Maricha imitating my voice in the form of a deer, he, sent by Sita will come for me at once, leaving her behind."

"'Hence the murder of Sita must have been jointly planned by the demons. Maricha who had assumed the form of a golden deer, took me away from the hermitage to a faroff place where, killed by my arrows, he turned a demon uttering the words, Alas, Lakshmana, I am killed."

"'On account of living in this dense forest in Janasthana I have earned enmity with the demons. Will Lakshmana and Sita be safe without my protection? I see many terrible portents.'"

"On hearing the jackal's howl, Rama began thinking how the demon in the form of a deer drew him away. Thus in the midst of apprehensions he reached Janasthana."

'Dejected at heart, the birds and animals piteously kept the great soul (Rama) to the left and produced a dreadful cacophony.'

'On seeing such dreadfu omens at that time, Rama hurried back to his hermitage.'

'Rama arrived at Janasthana thinking (of the safety) of charming Sita and mighty Lakshmana.'

'He then saw Lakshmana coming towards him with a cheerless face. When the sad, depressed Lakshmana came near, he saw Rama (equally) despondent and griefstricken.'

'In this situation Rama the elder brother rebuked Lakshmana for having left Sita behind in a desolate forest infested with demons.'

"Rama, the delight of the Raghus, took hold of Lakshmana's left hand, and in sadness said these sweet harsh words :"

'O gentle Lakshmana you are to blame for coming here, leaving Sita behind. Alas will she be safe now?'

'O heroic Lakshmana I see many inauspicious omens. I think Sita might have been lost or eaten away by the demons of the forest. There is no doubt about it.'

'O Lakshmana, a tiger among men, will we be able to see the daughter of Janaka, living in a state of total wellbeing? Will we be able to get her back ?'

'O  mighty Lakshmana  from the way the beasts, jackals and birds too have turned in the bright direction of the Sun, crying in a frightful manner, can we hope princess Sita is safe ?'

'Appearing in the guise of a deer, this demon allured me to a great distance. With much effort he was somehow killed. but he assumed his demoniac form while dying.'

'With my heart dejected and depressed, my left eye throbbing, O Lakshmana, I have no doubt that Sita is either abducted or dead or abandoned on the way.', 'इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे सप्तपञ्चाशस्सर्गः।।', 'Thus ends the fiftyseventh sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.'

'Rama, son of Dasaratha, the righteous self, saw Lakshmana downcast and dejected. Seeing him  without Sita, Rama enquired:'

'Where is that princess from Videha who accompanied me when I entered Dandaka forest ? Why have you come here leaving her behind ?'

'Where is that princess from Videha, a sharer of my sorrows, Sita of slender waist who followed this hapless prince disloged from the kingdom into the Dandaka forest?'

'O warrior Lakshmana where is that Sita without whom I have no interest to live for a moment, who was like the daughter of a god and a sustainer of my life?'

'O Lakshmana I desire no lordship of the gods  or of the entire earth without that daughter of Janaka, that lady of golden complexion. '

'O gentle Lakshmana I wonder if Vaidehi, who is dearer to me than my life is still alive ', 'I hope my banishment from the kingdom is not going to prove false.'

'O Saumitri when I am dead on account of Sita, and you are back, Kaikeyi with her desire fulfilled will be happy, indeed.'

'O handsome one  I wonder if that lady of renunciation, Kausalya with her son dead, will have to serve Kaikeyi whose desire would be fulfilled, and who will enjoy the power of the throne in the company of her son'

'O Lakshmana, only if Vaidehi is alive will I enter the cottage again or else I will give up ', 'my life if that virtuous lady is no more.'

'I will die if Sita, princess from Videha, is not there to speak to me with her sweet smile when I return to the cottage, O Lakshmana '

'Tell me, O Lakshmana   if Sita is alive or not, whether she was eaten up by demons when you were off your guard.'

'Vaidehi is delicate, young and she has never faced any sorrow.She will be certainly disheartened due to separation from me.'

"The evilminded, wicked demon calling out loudly 'O Lakshmana' must have by all means instilled fear in your mind."

'I am afraid, Vaidehi, frightened by hearing the voice which was like mine sent you to see me, and you came all at once.'

'You have definitely done a great mistake by leaving Sita alone in the forest. This has given a chance to the cruel demons to wreak revenge.'

'The dreadful, carnivorous demons aggrieved over my murder of Khara must have undoubtedly killed Sita.'

'O destroyer of enemies  I am completely drowned in sorrow. What can I do at this moment. Alas, I am destined to suffer.'

'While thus brooding over the beautiful Sita, the scion of the Raghus along with Lakshmana hurried towards Janasthana.'

"Thus blaming his dejected brother, the valiant Rama entered the hermitage, sighing deeply, his face pale and his throat dried up with hunger, exhaustion and thirst. Reaching his dwellingplace, he found it empty. He thoroughly searched the hermitage and the places where she used to move about on the premises. And 'so it has happened', he sadly said to himself, his hair raised on end.", 'इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे अष्टपञ्चाशस्सर्गः।।', 'Thus ends the fiftyeighth sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.'

'Rama, the delight of the Raghus, once again questioned Lakshmana who had come out of the hermitage, deeply hurt:'

'Why did you come, leaving the princess from Mithila alone in the forest when I had left her under your trust ?'

'When I saw you, O Lakshmana, coming without Sita, my mind was oppressed with evil thought which have come true.'

'O Lakshmana, as I saw you from a distance without Sita, my left eye, my shoulder and my heart throbbed.'

'Thus addressed, virtuous Lakshmana, overwhelmed with sorrow replied to the grief stricken Rama:'

'I did not leave her on my own nor have I  come here of my own accord. I came to you, ', 'provoked by her angry  words.'

"Uttered loudly, 'Alas Sita, Alas, Lakshmana, save me', as if these were the words of your noble self, reached Sita's ears. "

'The princess from Mithila heard this cry of pain and, wild with fear, urged me out of her love for you to go.'

'When I was repeated asked to go, I said this in order to instil confidence in the princess from Mithila : '

"'No one  can cause fear in Rama. I do not see any demon who can hold a threat to him. Give up fear. Some one might have said it."

"'How can Rama who is capable of saving even gods speak such unworthy, demeaning words, 'Save me, O Sita'"

"O fair lady, for some reason some demon  has uttered these words 'Save me, save me' adapting my brother's voice."

"'Lakshmana, save me' are the words uttered in an altered tone. Like an ordinary, lowborn woman you are not to feel concerned for this."

"'You should not feel agitated or dispirited. Be composed. There is no one either born or going to be born in the three worlds who can defeat Rama in war. He cannot be conquered in a battle even by gods led by indra.'"

'Deluded by her senses, Vaidehi said these words, shedding tears when I  tried to ', 'console  her:'

"'You have an extremely sinful intention of getting me  when your brother is dead. But you will not be able to gain me."

"'Since you are not reaching out to Rama who is helplessly crying for his rescue, you must have followed Rama, instructed by Bharata (to do him harm)'৷৷"

"'You are an enemy moving in disguise with an interest in me. You are waiting for an opportunity to set aside Rama. That is why you are not rushing to him.'"

'At these words from the princess of Videha, I came out of the hermitage in an agitated mood with my eyes turned red and lips quivering in anger.'

'To Lakshmana thus reporting, Rama, overcome with grief, said,(Even then) O noble brother your coming here, leaving her behind, is a wrong step taken.'

"You have come out of the hermitage provoked by Maithili's angry words, even though you are aware that I am capable of warding off the demons."

'I am not happy with you as you have come here deserting Sita on the plea that she was angry and spoke harsh words.'

'Provoked by the words of Sita spoken in anger you came without respecting my orders. It is definitely an act of disobedience.'

'This demon who misled me in the guise of a deer and took me away from the hermitage, lies dead, killed by my arrow.'

'Bending the bow I fixed the arrow and released it at ease. Hit by that arrow he gave up his guise of the deer and assuming the form of a demon with a bracelet on his arm fell down groaning.'

'Hit by the arrow, the demon imitating my voice cried out in desperation which could be clearly audible even from a distance. On hearing the dreadful words you deserted Sita and came here.', 'इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे एकोनषष्टितमस्सर्गः।।', 'Thus ends the fiftyninth sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.'

'As  Rama was returning( to the hermitage), his left eye throbbed repeatedly  and he stumbled and his body trembled.'

'As inauspicious omens appeared again and again, doubting if all is well with Sita, he said to himself, Can Sita be safe?'

'Anxious to see Sita, he hastened to the hermitage and finding it empty, became ', 'restless.'

'Rama, the delight of the Raghu dynasty, hurtled in, turning round, throwing his hands to and fro, casting his looks all around the cottage where she used to move. The cottage, devoid of Sita looked like a lotuspond, the beauty of its lotuses destroyed by winter.'

'The trees with flowers withered, the animals and birds turned pale looked as if they ', 'were weeping. Bereft of their beauty they wore a ruinous look. The sylvan deities had left.  The deerskin and kusa grass were strewn here and there, the grass cushions and straw mats lay scattered. Seeing his cottage so desolate Rama wept again and again.'

"'Timid Sita might have been abducted or dead or crushed or eaten up by demons. Or, she may be hiding for protection in the forest'"

"'Maybe she has gone to pluck flowers or fruits. Or to the lotuspond or river to  fetch water.'"

'He ransacked the forest, yet did not find his beloved. He  appeared like a mad man, his eyes turned red with tears of sorrow.'

'Running from tree to tree, hill to hill, and river to river and weeping, Rama was immersed in a sea of sorrow.'

'O Kadamba tree, tell me if you have seen my beloved with a fair face and with love for kadamba flowers.'

'O Bilva tree, tell me if you have seen a lady delicate like your tender leaf, dressed in yellow silk, a lady whose breasts are round like Bilva fruits.'

'O Arjuna tree, tell me if you know a timid lady, daughter of Janaka and my beloved, fond of Arjuna tree. Is the living or not ?'

'This Kakubha tree rich with tender leaves and flowers (perhaps)knows Maithili whose thighs are beautiful like the trunk of the Kakubha tree.'

'This great Tilaka tree round which bees bumble surely knows the lady who loves to put tilaka marks on the forehead.'

'O Ashoka tree, dispeller of sorrow, by quickly showing me my darling make me ashoka (free from sorrow) as I am griefstricken at heart.'

'O Palmyra tree be kind to me and tell me if you have seen my beautiful beloved who has breasts like ripe palmyra fruit? '

'O Jambu tree, do not hesitate to tell me if you know Sita whose body shines lovely like gold.'

'O Karnikara tree with flowers in full bloom, tell me if you have seen my faithful beloved who is fond of karnikara flowers.'

'Renowned Rama, like a madman confused, approached the Mango, Kadamba , Sal and Jackfruit, Dhava, Champak, Ketaki trees and Pomegranate, Jasmine and Madhavi creepers, in order to make similar queries.'

'Or,  O deer do you know about Maithili who has the eyes of a fawn? My beloved who has the restless eyes of a doe may be found in their company.'

'O elephant tell me if you have seen her whose thighs are like the trunk of an elephant. O best of elephants, tell me if you know her.'

'O tiger tell me freely and fearlessly if you have seen my beloved princess from Mithila with a face like the moon.'

'O lotus eyed darling, why are you running away? I have already seen you.  Why are you hiding behind trees and not replying to me?'

'O my beautiful beloved, stay, stay  Have you no compassion for me ? You are so fond of fun. Why do you avoid me?'

'O lady of lovely complexion, I can see your yellow silk (flying), while you are running away. If you have love for me, stay on.'

'O lady with a sweet smile I have never hurt you. When I am in difficulty it does not behove you to ignore me.'

'It is clear that separated from me, the body of my young beloved is torn off and eaten away by carnivorous demons.'

'Her beautiful face with her sparkling teeth and lips, wellshaped nose, shining earrings has been like the full moon, eclipsed and rendered pale.'

'That delicate, beautiful neck of my beloved having the complexion of a champak flower and adorned with necklaces was perhaps eaten up.'

'Her arms, delicate like tender leaves, their tips (fingers) quivering, adorned with armlets and bracelets have surely been eaten away.'

'The young lady having many relations, forsaken by me, has been (perhaps) picked up by a demon for food and later abandoned halfeaten.'

' ', 'O longarmed Lakshmana, are you able to see my beloved anywhere? O noble lady, O darling, where have you gone? O Sita  SIta  '

'Rama ran from forest to forest, now jumping, now taking strong strides, but all the time weeping, a madman busy in search of his beloved.'

'He rushed through forests, rivers, hills and mountain streams and through dense jungles with an unstable mind.'

'Rama went about the vast forest searching for the princess from Mithila all over not giving up hope of finding her. He continued to make great efforts for searching his beloved.', 'इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे षष्टितमस्सर्गः।।', 'Thus ends the sixtieth sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.'

'Rama, son of Dasaratha, saw the empty cottage devoid of Sita. The mats were displaced. He searched everywhere but unable to see Vaidehi lifted his lovely arms and said:'

'O son of Sumitra, where is my beloved ? Where did she go? By whom was she abducted? Or, devoured? O Lakshmana '

'O Sita if you intend to make fun by hiding behind a tree, I tell you it is enough. Stop it and come to this extremely sorrowful man.'

'O gentle  Sita those fawns who trusted you and played with you, are now separated from you. Brooding over you, their eyes are brimming with tears.'

"O Lakshmana, I cannot live without Sita. I am filled with deep grief on account of Sita's abduction. My late father, the king will certainly see me in the other world (I will definitely commit suicide)."

'My father say will surely in the other world: Without completing the appointed period of the vow taken, how could you come here ? Fie upon you  You are irresponsible. You are ignoble. You are a liar.'

'O lovely lady where have you gone, leaving me here like fame deserting a crook? I am helpless griefstricken, pitiable, pathetic and disappointed. O lady of slender waist, leave me not. Separated from you, I will give up my life.'

'Deeply distressed, Rama who was anxious to see Sita, daughter of Janaka, wailed and wailed but could not see her.'

'Lakshmana, dedicated to his wellbeing, spoke to Rama, son of Dasaratha, who was sinking like an elephant into the quagmire, when he failed to trace Sita.'

'O longarmed, heroic Rama, do not grieve. This forest is full of caves. Let us try together.'

'Sita is madly in love with the forest. She might have entered deep into the jungle or into a fully blossomed lotuspond.'

'Maybe she has gone to take a dip in the river full of reeds and fishes  Or has hidden somewhere for the sake of fun.'

'O best of men, maybe Vaidehi has hidden in the forest intending to scare you and me. She wishes to test our love. O blessed Rama let us ransack the forest immediately.'

'O scion of the Kakutsthas, let us search all over the forest if you please. Do not indulge in sorrow.'

'When Lakshmana consoled him so affectionately Rama became composed. He continued the search with Lakshmana, son of Sumitra.'

'The two sons of Dasaratha went on searching for Sita in forests, mountains, rivers, ponds everywhere.'

'They were not able to find Sita even though they searched all over the mountain slopes, caves and peaks.'

'After searching her all over, Rama said  Saumitri, I am unable to find the noble Vaidehi on the mountain'

'Going about the Dandaka forest Lakshmana, consumed by sorrow, said  to his brother, glowing with brilliance:'

'O longarmed brother O wise sire  just as Visnu obtained the earth by binding Bali you will obtain Sita certainly.'

"Having been addressed thus by Lakshmana, Raghava with a griefstriken heart said these piteous words :'", 'Lakshmana,having  spoken like that very affectionately to Rama,who was disturbed by excessive grief said these words piteously:'

'O wise Lakshmana I have searched the entire forest, the ponds with fully blossomed lotuses, the mountains with many caves and streams. But could not see Vaidehi who is dearer to me than my life.'

'Thus tormented by the abduction of Sita, Rama felt dejected and cried.Overpowered by grief he lost his consciousness for a moment.'

'By grief tormented, limbs enervated, intellect atrophied, senses switched off, he felt anxious and depressed and sighed long and hot.'

'Rama, his throat choked, shed propuse tears, sighing, O my darling.'

'Then Lakshmana, the knower of dharma and a dear friend offered obeisance most humbly with folded palms and consoled Rama in many ways.'

'Without caring  for the words from the lips of Lakshmana, Rama sobbed loudly, unable to see his beloved Sita.', 'इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे एकषष्टितमस्सर्गः।।', 'Thus ends the sixtyfirst sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.'

'The righteous, the longarmed,lotuseyed Rama, unable to see Sita wept with his senses overwhilmed by grief.'

'Under the spell of Cupid, Rama uttered such words in grief which are otherwise unutterable. As if he was seeing Sita (before him) which was not a fact.'

'O my beloved  as you love flowers you are hiding your body behind the branches of ', 'the Ashoke tree that enhances my sorrow (paradoxically).'

'O Devi I can see both your thighs which resemble banana trunk hidden behind a banana plant. It is not possible for you to hide them from me.'

'O gentle one  you are wandering in the karnikara garden, laughing and making fun. Enough of this , that causes my pain.'

'O my dear Sita, why are you joking when I am exhausted? Such fun cannot be relished  now.'

'O darling  joking specially in a hermitage  is not appreciated. I know your nature.You love fun. O largeeyed Sita, come here. This cottage of yours is empty.'

'O Lakshmana surely Sita is either devoured by demons or abducted. When I am weeping like this she is not coming to me.'

'O Lakshmana, these herds of deer with their eyes filled with tears are as if telling me that she is eaten away by the demons.'

"Alas, my noble lady, where have you gone? O chaste lady of excellent complexion, that queen Kaikeyi's desire will be fulfilled now."

'I left home with Sita. How can I reenter the inner apartment without her ?'

"By Sita's abduction it will be  clear to the world that I lack manliness and compassion. My cowardly nature will clearly manifest. "

'After completing the period of my exile when Janaka , king of Mithila, enquires of her welfare how can I face him?'

'If the king of Videha sees me without her, he will surely be distressed and will fall into a swoon for the love of his daughter.'

'Or else, I will not go to the city ruled by Bharata. Without Sita even heaven will be empty for me.'

'Go to the auspicious city of Ayodhya, leaving me here in the woods. I can never live without Sita.'

"While embracing Bharata tightly, repeat my words, 'You are permitted by Rama to rule the earth.'"

'My mother Kaikeyi, Sumitra and Kausalya  should also be offered due obeisance. You should protect them with great effort, carrying out my instructions.'

'O Lakshmana, subduer of the enemy this loss of Sita and me should be explained in detail to my mother.'

'When Rama, devoid of  Sita, the lady with beautiful hair, wailed piteously after reaching the forest, Lakshmana too, his face pale out of fear and mind dejected, felt extremely agitated.', 'इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे द्विषष्टितमस्सर्गः।।', 'Thus ends the sixtysecond sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.'

'Prince Rama, separated from his beloved, lost his senses out of sorrow. Seeing his brother in a distressed state, he sank again into intense grief.'

'Plunged in deep grief, Rama heaved hot sighs and said these words to griefstricken Lakshmanaweeping:'

'I think there is none on earth like me who has performed such forbidden acts.  One grief after the other is successively piercing my heart and my mind.'

'In the past I had certainly done some sinful deeds I often liked the consequences of which have descended on me now as I am experiencing one sorrow after another.'

'O Lakshmana, loss of kingdom, separation from kith and kin, death of father, separation from mother--all these thoughts augment my sorrow faster and in greater measure. '

"O Lakshmana, all this sorrow calmed down when I came to this solitary forest. But with Sita's separation, it was rekindled just as fire blazes forth again with logs of wood. "

'The timid princess of mine forcibly carried away into the sky by a demon must have again and again cried aloud out of fear in a broken voice.'

'Her captivating copper coloured skin, smeared with the best of red sandal paste would not be surely pleasing now, drenched in blood and mud.'

'Her face with her clear, sweet and gentle words and her curly hair falling will no more look bright coming under the grip of demons like the moon eclipsed by Rahu.'

'The bloodthirsty demons must have drunk the blood of my faithful beloved in a lonely place breaking her neck that used to wear beautiful necklaces.'

'The lovely, largeeyed lady separated from me in the desolate forest, abducted and dragged by demons must have cried at that time desperately like a female osprey.'

'On this rock, O Lakshmana, my goodnatured lady with her lovely smile sat with me in the past and chatted with you.'

'Would she have gone to Godavari, the foremost of the rivers so dear at all times to my beloved ? But I think she has not gone there alone at any time.'

'The lady whose face was like the lotus, whose large eyes were like lotus petals could  have gone to fetch lotuses (but) that also is not possible as she has never gone there without me.'

'Could she have gone to the forest where there are many kinds of trees in full bloom inhabited by a variety of birds? That is also not possible as she is timid and too scared to go there alone.'

'O Sungod, you know all the happenings of the world. You are witness to all the deeds of the people, true and false. Tell me where my beloved Sita has gone or has been carried off. My grief never ceases.'

'O Windgod, there is nothing that you know not in all the worlds. Do tell me if  that lady of a noble race has been abducted or dead or is on the way.'

'While Rama was thus in tears, in a state of sorrow and swoon, Lakshmana who was rational and courageous spoke to him words appropriate to the time :'

'O noble prince, give up grief. Take courage. Show enthusiasm to search and find Sita. Enthusiastic people will not get despondent in carrying out the  most difficult tasks.'

'Rama who carries on the (glorious) progeny of the Raghu dynasty, did not (however) consider seriously the words of Lakshmana, a man of great prowess. Forsaking his courage he was once again overtaken by deep sorrow.', 'इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे त्रिषष्टितमस्सर्गः।।', 'Thus ends the sixtythird sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.'

'Rama in dejection said these pitiable words to Lakshmana,O Lakashmana, go swiftly to the river Godavari and find out if Sita has gone there to get lotuses.'

'Lakshmana, destroyer of enemywarriors, went to the beautiful river Godavari with quick steps following the instruction of Rama.'

'Searching for Sita at the landings of river Godavari, Lakshmana said to Rama, I am unable to find her at these landings.No one responds to my call.'

'Where could Vaidehi, destroyer of sorrow, go? I wonder. I am unable to trace the spot where the daughter of Janaka could be found. '

"Overwhelmed with grief on hearing Lakshmana's words, Rama himself went to river Godavari, and shouted, where are you, Sita?"

'Like the elements of Nature, river Godavari did not disclose Rama that Sita had been abducted by the king of demons who deserved death.'

'River Godavari (although) prompted by creatures (of Nature) to tell him about his beloved did not respond to brooding Rama.'

"Remembering the evilminded Ravana's appearance and action, the river revealed nothing about Vaidehi out of fear."

'Disappointed by the river and emaciated by not being able to see Sita, Rama said to Lakshmana :'

'O handsome Lakshmana this Godavari does not at all respond. How can I go to Janaka and my mother without Sita and break this unhappy news?'

'Where could have gone that Vaidehi, who  removed all my sorrows and sufferings when I lost my kingdom and survived on food available in the forest?'

'Away from relatives and away from the princess, I keep awake during nights which seem too long.'

'I will roam about the river Godavari, Janasthana and this mount Prasravana till I find Sita.'

'O mighty Lakshmana these deer are looking at me again and again indicating that they wish to tell me something.'

"With his vision blurred by tears, Rama, the best among men, looked at them and asked them 'Where is Sita'?"

'Thus asked by the prince, all the deer got up suddenly, and pointed towards the southern sky, the direction in which the princess from Mithila was carried off. Looking at the Lord of men (Rama), they started running in that direction.'

'Even Lakshmana marked that the deer were showing and looking at the path lying in that direction.'

'Observing intelligently their indications and understanding the meaning of their message, Lakshmana said to his distressed elder brother:'

'O lord these deer are indicating the land on the southern side.Therefore it will be proper for both of us to proceed in the southwestern direction. Maybe we will get some clue or find that noble Sita.'

"Handsome Rama said, 'yes'and started in southern direction, carefully looking at the ground, followed by Lakshmana."

'Talking with each other, the two brothers took the path on earth strewn with flowers.'

'Seeing showers of flowers fallen on the ground, valiant Rama sadly said these words to sorrowful Lakshmana:'

'O Lakshmana, here are the same flowers I had given Vaidehi to wear in the forest. I can recognize them.'

'I think the Sun, the wind  and the famed earth have done me a favour by preserving these flowers.'

'Rigteous Rama, the best among men, having said these words to the longarmed Lakshmana, asked mount Prasravana, full of streams:'

'O king of the mountains have you seen a lady with beautiful limbs separated from me in this forest tract ?'

'Like a lion aiming at a petty animal, angry Rama  said, O Mountain before I destroy  all your slopes show me that goldenhued Sita with lustre like gold.'

'Thus addressed by Rama, the mountain echoed as if it was telling about Sita but did not show her to Rama.'

"Rama, Dasaratha's son said to the mountain, The fire of my arrows will reduce you to ashes.You will have no grass, no tree, no twig. You will be unfit to be served any more."

'O Lakshmana if this river does not tell me about that noble Sita with countenance like the moon, I will drain it dry right now.'

'While Rama was angry with his eyes burning, he saw on the ground as he advanced large footprints of a demon and then the footprints of Maithili which signified as if chased by the demon, she was frightened and was running hither and thither, longing to see Rama.'

'Bewildered to see the broken bow and quiver and many splinters of the chariot scattered all over, Rama said to his loving brother Lakshmana:'

'O Saumitri  see the many broken bits of gold ornaments and garlands.'

'See, O Lakshmana, the patches of blood looking like drops of shining gold spread all over the ground.'

'O Lakshmana, Vaidehi might have been cut into pieces, and eaten up by the demons who can assume any form at their free will.'

'O Lakshmana, two demons might have fought a dreadful duel at this place contesting with each other for the sake of Vaidehi. '

'O handsome Lakshmana whose is this huge bow embedded with pearls and gems and adorned with gold fallen on the ground?'

'Whose is this shield of gold studded with Vaidurya, broken and strewn all over the ground, shining like the morning Sun?'

'Whose parasol is this with a hundred spokes, festooned with wonderful flowers thrown down on the ground with broken staff ?'

"Whose are these donkeys, with golden chestcoverings, with the devil's face, fierceful and huge and slain in the encounter ?"

'Whose war chariot with a battle flag is this, shining like burning fire, turned upside down and broken?'

'Whose are these pointless arrows of the size of a chariot axle adorned with bright gold destroyed and scattered ? Who is he that has performed such terrible deeds?'

'O Lakshmana  look at these two quivers filled with arrows and lying shattered.  The charioteer is holding a whip and reins in his hands and is lying dead. To whom do they belong?'

'O best among men, O handsome Lakshmana see these carriers of fans with head dress and earrings studded with gems lying slain in the combat. Whose are they ?'

'This indeed is the path the man or the demon has traversed. My enmity with him now has become hundredfold. This will end only with the extermination of his life.'

'O handsome one, those demons can change their form at will and are of dreadful nature. Have they abducted or devoured or killed her in this great forest. Even her righteousness could not protect the helpless Sita.'

'If Sita has been devoured or kidnapped, none in this world or even gods could do anything to make me happy, O handsome Lakshmana '

'O Lakshmana even the compassionate and heroic Creator of the worlds will be disrespected by all beings, however ignorantly (if such things are allowed to happen).'

'The gods will certainly consider me a man engaged in the welfare of the world, a man of selfrestraint and compassion, but at the same time a weak man.'

'O Lakshmana even demerits turn into merits when they come in contact with me. Just as the Sun shines, effacing the moonlight, my brilliance will outshine my demerits of exterminating all (wicked) beings including the demons.'

'O Lakshmana, neither yakshas, nor goblins nor demons nor kinneras nor humans  will be in peace now.'

'O Lakshmana, just see, I will fill the sky with all my weapons and arrows and make all movements impossible in the three worlds.'

'I will obstruct the movement of planets and the Moon, destroy the radiance of the Sun, the fire and block the wind crush the mountain tops, dry up the tanks, destroy the trees shrubs and creepers and annihilate the oceans. I shall bring about this fatal change at once in the three worlds.   '

'If the gods do not return my Sita safely to me, O Lakshmana  they will witness my power right now.'

'Lakshmana no beings will be able to move in the sky, blocked by arrows released from my bowstring there will be no space left there.'

'O Lakshmna now beasts and birds will be confused and destroyed by my darts.You will see them crossing all limits of propriety.'

'For the sake of Maithili I will render this world devoid of goblins and demons with my irresistible arrows pulled up to my ears.'

'Now the gods will witness the power of my arrows released in great rage which can hit distant targets.'

'My anger will destroy all the gods, demons and evil spirits. They will be extinghished from the three worlds.'

'The worlds of gods, yakshas or even demons torn into shreds by my arrows will not  survive.'

'If the gods do not hand over Sita to me either carried away or dead I will transgress these worlds, O Lakshmana '

'If my beloved Vaidehi is not given back to me in her true form I will destroy the three worlds with all animate and inanimate beings.'

'After speaking these words, handsome Rama, his eyes red with anger, pressed his bow, took out the glowing arrow that was dreadful like a poisonous serpent, fixed it to his bow and said these words in a rage like the fire at the time of dissolution of the world.'

'Just as all beings in this world cannot avoid age and death, or defy time and fate so also none can prevent me at all when I am  angry, O Lakshmana '

'I will topsyturvy this entire world including the gods, the gandharvas, human beings, serpents and mountains if they do not show me the princess from Mithila, who is blemishless and whose teeth are beautiful', 'इत्यार्शे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकेय आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे चतुष्षष्टिमस्सर्गः।।', 'Thus ends the sixtyfourth sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.'

"Tormented and emaciated due to Sita's abduction, resembling the fire at the time of dissolution of the creation, ready to destroy the world, Rama looked at his bow strung again and again, breathing hot sighs like Lord Siva at the end of the creation, wishing to burn down the world in a rage. Lakshmana who had never seen Rama in such anger before said to him with folded hands and parched throat."

"Tormented and emaciated due to Sita's abduction, resembling the fire at the time of dissolution of the creation, ready to destroy the world, Rama looked at his bow strung again and again, breathing hot sighs like Lord Siva at the end of the creation, wishing to burn down the world in a rage. Lakshmana who had never seen Rama in such anger before said to him with folded hands and parched throat."

'Earlier you were gentle, self restrained and engaged in the welfare of all beings. (Now) it is not proper for you to give up your natural composure in anger.'

'In you are always present the grace of the Moon, the radiance of the Sun, the motion of the wind, the forbearance of the earth and reputation.'

'To destroy the world for the mistake of a single person is not proper. Why and by whom is this warchariot broken with weapons and all its accesories I do not know.'

'O prince, this place is damaged by the hooves of the horses and the rims of the chariot. It is soaked with drops of blood.Very dreadful must have been the fight here.'

'O, best of the eloquent  this fight involves only one and not two. I do not see the footprints of a big army.'

'To destroy the entire world for one individual is not right. The lords of the earth should remain gentle, peaceful and punish only the deserving.'

'You are the ultimate resort and refuge of all beings. Who would like that your wife should be abducted ?'

'Just as pious men do not do anything disagreeable towards persons who observe religious vows, so also rivers, seas and mountains, gods, gandharvas and demons are not capable of causing unhappiness to you.'

' ', 'O king bow in hands, followed by me and with the help of great sages you should search for the one who has abducted Sita.'

'We will search oceans, mountains, forests and several dreadful caves, rivers and lotusponds.'

'We will search relentlessly for the abductor of your wife everywhere including the world of gods and gandharvas till we find her.'

'O lord of Kosala when gods do not restore Sita on request, then you can think of taking action at the appropriate time.'

"O king if you fail to get Sita through appeasement, through humility or diplomacy then you destroy (the three worlds) by your goldtipped stream of arrows comparable to Indra's thunderbolt.", 'इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे पञ्चषष्टितमस्सर्गः।।', 'Thus ends the sixtyfifth sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.'

'Lakshmana, son of Sumitra, consoling the mighty miserable Rama, who was afflicted with sorrow, and was weeping helplessly like an orphan, drowned in great delusion, devoid of consciousness, pressed his feet and addressed him:'

'Lakshmana, son of Sumitra, consoling the mighty miserable Rama, who was afflicted with sorrow, and was weeping helplessly like an orphan, drowned in great delusion, devoid of consciousness, pressed his feet and addressed him:'

'O Rama king Dasaratha begot you by doing a great penance and performing great deeds, just as gods begot the nectar.'

'King Dasaratha, impelled by your virtues, and separation from you attained godhood as heard from Bharata.'

'O Rama, if you cannot bear this sorrow that has befallen you, how can weak and ordinary persons endure (such suffering)?'

'O best of men  if you grieve and burn the world with your brilliance, wherefrom will the (ordinary) afflicted people get relief?'

'It is the go of the world. Yayati, son of Nahusa, shared heaven with Indra but because of his curse (for his bad conduct) suffered misfortune.'

"To sage Vasistha, our father's priest, were born a hundred sons in a day.But all of them were killed in one day the same way."

'You (rigidly) adhere to truth.(Like you) the mother earth who is adored by all the worlds, is unshakeable. Yet she is seen to be shaking at times.'

'The powerful Sun and Moon, righteous entities, who are the two eyes of these worlds and on whom everything rests firmly, also suffer eclipses sometimes.'

'O best among men  Fate spares none. Great beings, every creature, even the gods cannot escape fate.'

'It is I heard that Indra and other deities are also governed by the principle of justice. Therefore, you should not bewail, O tiger among men.'

'Even if Vaidehi is killed or abducted, you should not grieve like ordinary men, O ', 'sinless hero '

'O Rama, you always see the truth. So  in the face of great difficulties men like you, whose vision is not blurred, should not lose heart.'

'O best among men  judge the facts rightly with your intellect. The wise apply their minds and know what is right and what is wrong.'

'Good results are not expected from the actions of persons who cannot distinguish between their virtues and vices, from those who are unstable in their deeds.'

'O Rama you yourself in the past have instructed me many times that way. Who can be your adviser in this matter ? You are indeed like Brihaspati.'

'Even gods cannot fathom your intellect. I am only trying to rouse your wisdom your sorrow has sent to sleep.'

'O bull among the Ikshvakus, weigh your divine and human prowess before you try to kill your enemies.'

'O best among men  where is the good in the destruction of all? Know your sinful enemy before you uproot him.', 'इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकेय आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे षट्षष्टितमस्सर्गः।।', 'Thus ends the sixtysixth sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.'

'Even though Rama was elder, he could grasp the quintessence of the wise counsel only after Lakshmana had said it.'

'Restraining his anger, the longarmed Rama leaned over  his wonderful bow and spoke to Lakshmana:'

'O dear Lakshmana, what shall we do? Where do we go ? Think of some means by which we can reach Sita.'

'Lakshmana said to Rama, afflicted with grief, It is proper for you to (first) search in this Janasthana, covered with different kinds of trees and creepers, and teeming with demons.'

'Here are difficult mountains, caves, valleys, dreadful caves full of different animals, dwellingplaces of kinneras and mansions of gandharvas.'

'Accompanied by me you should search for her in those spots. Great people endowed with wisdom do not destabilise in difficulties just as mountains are not shaken by the speed of the wind. '

'Thus advised, the angry Rama fixed a sharp arrow to his bow and roamed in the forest accompanied by Lakshmana.'

'Then he saw the great Jatayu, a wonderful bird, looking like a mountain top, drenched in blood and fallen on the ground.'

'On seeing Jatayu looking like the peak of a mountain, Rama said to Lakshmana, There is no doubt that this bird has devoured Vaidehi.'

'This demon in the guise of a vulture has evidently eaten away the largeeyed Sita and is happily relaxing in the forest. With my terrific arrows with burning tips that can go straight I will kill him.'

'Having siad so, Rama took his bow, fixed the sharp arrow, and aimed at the vulture. The seabound earth trembled.'

'But the vulture who was in a piteous state, vomitting foamy blood, spoke these words pathetically to Rama, son of Dasaratha:'

'O Longlived one  she who you are searching in the forest like herbal medicine has been carried away by Ravana along with my life.'

'I have seen her snatched from you and from Lakshmana and carried off by powerful Ravana.'

'I descended down to protect Sita, and in the battle with Ravana his chariot destroyed fell down here on the ground.'

'O Rama this is his broken bow, this is his quiver and this is his warchariot all devastated by me.'

"He is Ravana's charioteer slain by my wings in the battle.  As I was exhausted in the encounter Ravana clipped my wings,  took Sita, and flew into the sky. You need not kill me. I am already slain by the demon."

'Having known from Jatayu the story of his beloved Sita, Rama was full of tears, his grief redoubled.'

'Rama dropped the bow and embraced the king of birds. He fell down despondent on the ground and began crying along with Lakshmana.'

'Rama saw Jatayu breathing with difficulty in that solitary, inaccessible place.Overcome by greater grief  he said to Lakshmana:'

'I have been expelled from the kingdom. I am made to stay in the forest. I have lost Sita (my beloved wife). This bird (who was my wellwisher) has been slain. Such misfortune will burn even fire. '

'Now if I enter even the great sea, the lord of the rivers filled with water, it will also dry up due to my misfortune.'

'In this world of the animate and the inanimate there is no one more unfortunate than me fallen into the trap of adversities.'

"This aged king of birds is my father's friend. To my illluck, he is struck down and is lying on the ground."

'Saying such words and showing filial affection, he caressed Jatayu repeatedly with Lakshmana.'

'Rama hugged the king of vultures with servered wings, drenched in blood and asking him where Sita who was as dear to him as his life was, he dropped him and fell down on the ground.', 'इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे सप्तषष्टितमस्सर्गः।।', 'Thus ends the sixtyseventh sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.'

'Seeing the vulture lying on the ground thrown down by the fierce demon, Rama said to friendly Lakshmana:'

'Struck down by the demon in the combat on my account this bird is going to give up his life which is indeed difficult.'

'O Lakshmana, it appears he is frightened and is experiencing excruciating pain in the body. His voice sounds faint, too.'

'O Jatayu If you are still able to speak, tell me about Sita and about how you have been struck down. '

'Why did Ravana abduct Sita? What fault did he find with me so that he kidnapped my beloved ?'

'O best of birds how did her delightful, Moonlike face look when she was hijacked. What did she say at that time?'

'O father  how powerful is that demon ? How does he look?What work does he do? Where does he dwell? Do answer my questions?'

'Thereafter Jatayu, a piteous soul, looked up at Rama who was  crying incessantly and said this in a feeble voice:'

'Ravana, the lord of the demons created violent winds through terrific magic and whisked her away in the sky.'

'O my child  when I was exhausted, that demon cut off my wings and carried Sita off in the southern direction.'

'O scion of the Raghu race, I am gasping for breath. My eyes are reeling. I see root hair growing on the tops of golden trees.'

"The time Ravana kidnapped Sita is known as 'Vinda'. The effect (of that time), is that her husband will regain his lost wealth. O scion of the Kakutstha race  he (Ravana )did not know it."

'Ravana, king of the demons, will perish soon for running away with your beloved Janaki just like a fish carrying away a fishhook (which causes its destruction).'

"You need not worry about Janaka's daughter. You will soon enjoy the company of your beloved, Vaidehi after killing that demon."

"As he(Jatayu) was speaking to Rama with an alert mind even while dying, blood mixed with flesh started oozing from Jatayu's mouth."

"Ravana was Visrava's son and Vaisravana's (Kubera's) brother, said Jatayu and gave up his rare life."

"As Rama was saying to the vulture with folded palms 'Tell me, tell me'( about Ravana) the life breath of the vulture soared into the sky leaving the body."

'Then Jatayu dropped his head down, his feet thrown about, his body outstretched on earth.'

'Stricken with deep grief, his eyes red (with tears) Rama saw the vulture looking like a mountain. Seeing him dead, he said to Lakshmana:'

'Dwelling for many years happily in Dandaka forest, the abode of demons, the bird lost his life (on our account).'

'This Jatayu, who lived for long years, is lying dead now. (The dictate of) destiny is inescapable.'

'O Lakshmana, see this Jatayu, my benefactor, killed by the powerful Ravana while he was reaching out to help Sita.'

'This lord of the birds left his ancestral kingdom of viltures and gave up life for my sake.'

'O Lakshmana valiant souls and protectors, being righteous and honest are found even among animals and birds.'

"O scorcher of enemies, O handsome Lakshmana the grief I experience due to Jatayu's death on my account is more intense than Sita's abduction."

'This lord of the birds for me is as worthy of reverence and honour as the famous and prosperous king Dasaratha.'

'O Saumitri  fetch firewood. I shall generate fire by rubbing them and cremate the king of the birds who has laid down his life for my sake.'

'O scion of the Raghus  I will place the body of the lord of the world of birds, killed by the fierce demon, on the funeral pyre and crimate him with honour. '

'O mighty lord of the birds  by my grace attain the state of those who perform sacrifices, who kindle and maintain sacrificial fires, who beat no retreat from the battlefield and who offer land in charity. Purified by my offering of fire, you may depart for the best of the worlds. '

'Thus said, righteous Rama laid him on the pyre and sadly cremated the lord of the birds as one would do to his own relative.'

'Then the mighty Rama, accompanied by Saumitri, got into the forest and killed a huge ', 'deer, brought it and spread it as an offering (to the dead Jatayu).'

'Tearing the flesh of the deer to pieces and making them  into balls, the celebrated Rama laid it on a lovely, green grassy land as offering to the bird.'

'Rama muttered the mantras recommended by brahmins for dead mortals as one would do for his father, to help him ascend to heaven. '

'Then both the princes went down to river Godavari and offered libations for the king of vultures.'

'Thereafter both the scions of the Raghu dynasty bathed in water, offered libations for the king of vultures as ordained in the scriptures.'

"The king of vultures had performed a very difficult and glorious feat by laying down his life fighting. Sanctified by Rama's offering as laid down in scriptures by the seers, he attained a holy, auspicious and divine state of the self. "

'Rama and Lakshmana, like two lords of gods, Indra and Visnu, offered libations for the great bird with their settled minds and concentrated and then entered deeper into the forest turning their attention to the search for Sita.', 'इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे अष्टषष्टितमस्सर्गः।।', 'Thus ends the sixtyeighth sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.'
'Rama and Lakshmana offered libations (for Jatayu) and went westward, looking for Sita in the forest.'

'Wielding bow, arrows and sword, both the princes of the Ikshvaku race went southward and entered an untrodden (densely wooded) tract.'

'It was a dense, impenetrable and dreadful forest covered with shrubs, trees and creepers spread all over.'

'The two mighty heroes swiftly forged through the great forest, which was an abode of serpents and lions.'

'Both the mighty princes of the Raghu dynasty covered a distance of three krosas from Janasthana and entered the impassable kraunchaforest. '

'Tormented due to abduction of Sita, the two princes anxious to see her searched all over the dense forest stopping here and there on the way. The thick forest looked like a conglomeration of big clouds. It was filled with different kinds of birds, snakes and animals.'

'Then both the sons of Dasaratha, went further east, crossed the kraunchaforest after three krosas. They saw a dreadful forest which was full of fierce animals and birds near the hermitage of sage Matanga. It was densely covered with trees. They saw there a cave perpetually enveloped in darkness which was as deep as the netherworld.'

'Both the princes,the best among men, reached the cave and saw a huge demoness with a disfigured face not far from the cave.'

'Then the two brothers saw a fearful demoness who could strike terror in the mind of the timid, an uncouth figure with huge curved skins, with a big stomach, dishevelled hair, sharp and long teeth, devouring wild animals.'

'She came close to them, held Lakshmana who was walking ahead of his brother and said Come, let us enjoy.'

"Taking hold of Saumitri the demoness said 'I am Ayomukhi and I have been obtained by you. You got me, O hero, O lord  For the rest of your life you will sport with me on the lofty hills and river banks.'"

'Thus addressed, Lakshmana, subduer of enemies, became angry, took out the sword and cut off her ears, nose and breasts. '

'When the ears and nose of the frightening demoness were cut off she shouted in a fierce tone and ran away in the direction she had come from.'

'The destroyers of enemies, Rama and Lakshmana of great valour went through the dense forest after she ran away.  '

'Lakshmana of great brilliance and power, of good conduct and pure character spoke to his highly effulgent brother with folded hands:'

'My arm is throbbing heavily. My mind is agitated. The omens I see foretell some undesirable events.'

'O noble brother be alert. Heed my words of good advice. The bad omens I see presage perils.'

"This vanchulaka bird's loud and dreadful screams suggest our triumph in war."

'As both the brothers with great prowess were searching for Sita all over, a huge ', 'sound exploded as if shattering the forest.'

'It appeared as though a fierce wind rose from the forest and filled the sky.'

'While looking for the sound, Rama with his brother saw a demon with a huge body and a big belly.'

' ', 'Then both the brothers saw a very tall figure with a trunk that stood facing them. He had neither neck nor head. His face was in the stomach.'

'With sharp bristled hair all over the body, he was a mammoth figure who looked like a mountain  resembling a dark cloud with his voice like the thunder. '

'He had a single eye that was reddishbrown in colour resembling flaming fire. It was fixed in the chest. His eyelashes glowed. He had instant vision with massive fangs in his huge mouth. He was licking his lips.'

'The terrific demon kept eating bears, lions, deer and elephants, catching with both his arms stretching up to one yojana. '

'He stood rooted there, catching bears, flocks of birds and deer with both his hands stretching up to one yojana, pulling and pushing them. (Now) he obstructed the path of the two brothers.'

'Then the brothers after covering one krosa (2 miles) saw a cruel, fierce, mighty monster named Kabandha looking like a trunk. He had a dreadful appearance and his arms encircled the area.'

'The longarmed demon spread his hands and caught hold of Rama and Lakshmana together by pressing them with all his force.'

'The two mighty brothers who wielded swords and strong bows and whose bodies were of fiery splendour became helpless, seized by the hands of Kabandha.'

'Of the two heroes, Rama being courageous was not worried but Lakshmana being younger and not having as much courage, was very much concerned and depressed. He said to Rama: '

'O heroic Rama see how helpless I am under the control of the demon. Set yourself free, leaving me alone and using me as an offering.'

'Giving me to this monstor as an offering, you may run away happily. I think you will soon obtain Vaidehi.'

'O scion of the Kakutstha dynasty, on getting the hereditary kingdom and ruling over it you should always remember me.'

'O  valiant Lakshmana, a hero like you should not get desparate. said Rama to Saumitri when he was thus entreated by Lakshmana.'

'In the meanwhile the foremost of the demons, Kabandha, rumbling like thunder questioned the brothers, Rama and Lakshmana:'

'Who are you with bulllike shoulders, wielding big swords, bows and arrows? By coming to this place you have become my food.'

'For what purpose have you come? What work have you here ? You have come at the right time as my food, since I am hungry.'

'Holding bows, arrows and swords, looking like bulls with pointed horns you have entered my mouth. It is impossible for you to live any more.'

'On hearing the words of the evilminded Kabandha, Rama said to Lakshmana with dried up mouth:'

'O Lakshmana, your valour is truth.We have gone through from one calamity to a greater one without finding the beloved Sita. Now we have landed into a terrible crisis which will put an end to our own life.'

'O tiger among men see how powerful the might of time is for all beings Just see  yourself and myself afflicted wth this great calamity.'

'O Lakshmana look at the power of time over all creatures There is nothing too heavy for time. Even those who know the use of arms in war, or are brave or strong enough, cannot  withstand the force of time like the barriers built with sand.'

'Firm in the strength of truth, famous and powerful Rama, son of Dasaratha,  determined to act with a steadfast mind, spoke to Lakshmana of mighty manliness on seeing him. ', 'इत्यार्ष श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे एकोनसप्ततितमस्सर्गः।।', 'Thus ends the sixtyninth sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.'

'Kabandha saw the brothers, Rama and Lakshmana, stand there bound by the shackles of his arms and said:'

'O bulls among the kshatriyas You are sent by destiny as food to appease my hunger. Seeing me hungry, why do you stand there with your senses switched off ?'

'Having heard this, Lakshmana, who was greatly suffering gathered courage at appropriate time and said these salutary words:'

'Before this vile demon gulps you and me let us cut off his long arms with our swords.'

'This huge, horrible demon with the strength of his arms has conquered the world, and now intends to kill us here.'

'O prince of the Raghu race  just as the animal brought in the midst of a sacrifice should not be killed, so also for a king to kill any harmless creature is despicable.'

'The cruel, ferocious demon heard them talk. He opened his mouth and attempted to eat both of them.'

'Then the agitated brothers, aware of time and space, quickly pulled out their swords and cut off both his arms from the shoulders.'

'While standing on the right, Rama cut off his right arm and the brave Lakshmana cut off the left.'

'The strongarmed demon, his arms severed, rumbling like a raincloud filling the sky, the earth and the quarters, fell down.'

'The demon with his arms amputated, drenched in a pool of blood  looked pathetic and asked them, Who are you? '

'Imbued with auspicious signs, Lakshmana revealed the identity of Rama to great Kabandha.'

'Here is Rama, an heir of the Ikshvaku family, known to the people and I am his younger brother Lakshmana for your information.'

'He is equal to a god in prowess. While living in this desolate forest his wife has been carried off by a demon. We both came here searching for her.'

'Who are you with only the trunk of the body, and a glittering mouth in the chest with your calf muscles broken rolling down in the forest?'

"While hearing Lakshmana, Kabandha, reminded of Indra's words, replied to him in great joy :"

'O tigers among men you are welcome. It is my good luck that I am able to see you. It is my good luck also that the arms that bound you have been amputated.'

'O best among men hear how I have been deformed due to my haughtiness.', 'इत्यार्ष श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे सप्ततितमस्सर्गः।।', 'Thus ends the seventieth sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.'

'O longarmed, mighty and powerful Rama in the past I was handsome like the Moon or Indra or the Sun inconceivable to all the three worlds.'

'With my appearance, I was a great nuisance to the world and used to terrorise the sages living in the forest.'

'With my appearance I invited the wrath of Sthulasira who I assaulted among the many seers, while he was collecting food in the forest.'

"Seeing me he pronounced a dreadful curse on me saying, 'You will get a cruel, despicable form.' "

'When I sought to know how the curse angrily pronounced on me would come to an end, he said:'

' ', "'When Rama gets your arms in a desolate forest amputated and your body cremated, you would get back your gloriously auspicious form.'"

'O Lakshmana know that I was the prosperous son of demon Danu. By the wrath of Indra in the battlefeild I obtained this form.'

'I pleased the creator Brahma with great penance. He blessed me with long life. Then this pride and confusion overtook me.'

'Having been blessed with long life and thinking, what can Indra do to me?, I attacked ', 'him. '

'The thunderbolt having a hundred nodes deployed by Indra pierced my thighs and my head.'

"Entreated, he did not send me to the abode of Yama ( lord of death) and said, 'Let the words of the creator be true' ."

'Hit by the thunderbolt, my thighbones, head and face were broken. Somehow I could manage to live for a long time without food. '

'Having been entreated, Indra created in me two long arms extending upto a yojana and set my mouth with sharp teeth in the stomach.'

'Stretching the long arms in the forest, I dragged creatures like lions, tigers, elephants and deer moving in the forest and ate them.'

"Indra too had said, 'When Rama along with Lakshmana cuts off your arms in a fight,  you would reach heaven.'"

'O Rama, the best of kings I thought it was only proper in this forest and with this body to catch whatever creature I saw.'

'O Rama, I was struggling to preserve my body all the time thinking that some day you would certainly come into my arms.'

'You are that Rama. Be blessed. As stated by the seer I cannot be really killed by any one except you.'

'O best among men I will help you with my wisdom and give you friendly advice when I am purified by you both through cremation on the funeral pyre.'

"Rigteous Rama spoke the following words in response to the story of Danu within Lakshmana's earshot:"

'My illlustrious wife Sita was carried away by Ravana comfortably when I was away from Janasthana along with my brother.'

'I only know his name. We do not know how he looks, where he lives and what influence he has.'

'Creatures like you may help those who, like orphans, run here and there, stricken with sorrow.'

'O hero we will cremate you in a huge pit to be prepared for this occasion, collecting dry logs of wood broken by elephants.'

' ', 'If you really know where SIta has been kidnapped and by whom, tell me. You will be ', 'doing a great service.'

'Danu who was proficient in speech spoke with chosen words to Rama who was a great speaker himself:'

'I do not have divine wisdom (now). Nor do I know Sita. When you cremate me, I shall assume my original form and will tell you the name of the person who knows it.'

'O lord before I am cremated, I do not have the ability to know  about that powerful demon by whom Sita has been abducted. '

'O Rama due to the curse I have lost my wisdom. By my own deed, I have attained this form despicable to the world.'

'Before the Sun  disappears with his tired horses drop me into a pit and cremate me in accordance with tradition, O Rama '

'O heroic Rama, delight of the Raghus, if you drop me in a pit and cremate me as per custom, I will tell you about him who knows the demon.'

'O Rama you should establish friendship with him in a just manner. That hero of swift action will help you when he is pleased.'

'O Rama, there is nothing that he does not know in the three worlds. In the past for a different reason he roamed all the (three) worlds.', 'इत्यार्ष श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे एकसप्ततितमस्सर्गः।।', 'Thus ends the seventyfirst sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.'

'Thus said by Kabandha, the two lords of men, the heroes reached a cave in the mountain and lighted the fire.'

'Lakshmana lit the pyre with big meteorlike logs on all sides and it burned.'

"As the flesh of Kabandha's body decomposed, if burnt slowly in the fire although it ", 'was like a huge mass of fat.'

'Mighty Kabandha shook himself off the funeral pyre and rose like smokeless fire, wearing a pair of clean clothes and a divine garland.'

'Thereafter shining brightly in pure clothes and wearing ornaments all over the body, Kabandha hurtled out happily and instantaneously from the pyre.'

"The effulgent Kabandha rose into the sky on a famous aerial chariot harnessed to swans. Seated on it, he illuminated all ten directions and spoke from the sky,'O Raghava I will truly tell you how you will get Sita, listen to me'."

'O Rama there are six expedients (peace,war,marching,neutrality, alliance, making peace with one and waging war with another, for attaining your goal in the world. Only the unlucky can help the unfortunate.'

'Along with Lakshmna you are passing through a bad period on account of which your wife has been kidnapped and you, lying low, are experiencing great grief, O Rama '

'O Rama, the best of friends  you should certainly make friendship with him. As I think over the matter, I do not see any success if you do not adopt this method.'

' ', 'O Rama, listen. I shall tell you. A monkey named Sugriva has been banished from the kingdom in a fit of anger by his brother Vali, the son of Indra.'

'A hero of great selfrespect, he lives with four monkeys on a beautiful mountain Rishyamuka extending up to lake Pampa.'

'This king of monkeys is energetic with great strength and limitless lustre. He is humble and truthful, valiant, patient and intelligent. He is great.'

' ', 'He is efficient, eloquent, brilliant. He is mighty and strong. (But) he is banished by his brother from the kingdom, O Rama  '

'O Rama he will help you as a benevolent friend in searching out Sita. Do not indulge in sorrow.'

' ', 'O best of the Ikshvaku race whatever is due to happen cannot be otherwise.  It is not ', 'possible to transgress time (fate). '

'O Rama, immediately proceed today from here to mighty Sugriva. Having reached him, make him your friend without malice in the presence of burning fire.'

' ', 'Thinking that Sugriva is only a vanara king, he should not be disrespected. He has a sense of gratitude. He can take any form at will. He is in need of your help although he is very strong.'

'You are both young and able to do the work he wants. Whether his work is done or not, he will fulfil your task.'

'Born of Riksharaja, he is the offspring of the Sungod. He has developed enmity with Vali, and is roaming about the banks of Pampa, suspecting danger from Vali.'

'O Rama, with your weapons kept ready, go to Sugriva, king of the monkeys, a resident of Rishyamuka. He is wandering in the forest. Establish friendship with him.'

'He is the foremost of the monkeys. He knows well by his wisdom all the ', 'dwellingplaces of the carnivorous demons in the world.'

'There is nothing unknown to Sugriva in this world as far as the Sun shines, O subduer of enemies'

'Along with his monkeys, he will search all rivers, mountains and caves and will find out your consort.'

'Sugriva will find out the lady of purity and chastity brooding over you in separation in the abode of Ravana. He can send gigantic monkeys in different directions in order to search for her.'

'Sugriva, king of the monkeys, will reach the demons  and restore you that blameless, beloved consort of yours, even if she is there on top of mount Meru or in the deep underworld. ', 'इत्यार्ष श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे द्विसप्ततितमस्सर्गः।।', 'Thus ends the seventysecond sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.'

'Having shown Rama the means to find Sita, Kabandha spoke again these significant words:'

'O Rama the delightful path going westward is auspicious for you. It is shining with trees in bloom. There are jambu (rose apple) trees, priyala trees, jackfruit trees, banyan trees, plaksha trees (a tree from which milky latex oozes out), tinduka trees, holy fig trees, karnikaras (of red and white flowers), mango trees and other trees like dryland, thorny trees, tilaka trees, trees that bloom at night, agnimukhya and asoka trees of blue flowers, kadamba trees, karavira trees, red ashoka trees, and paribhadraka trees.'

'Climbing those trees or else pulling them down with your strength, both of you eat the nectarlike sweet fruits and proceed ahead.'

'O scion of the Kakutstha race  proceeding further you will find another forest of the North Kuru state with trees in bloom resembling the pleasuregardens of Nandana.'

'The trees in that garden with fruits of all seasons drip honey. Like the Chaitraratha garden (of Kubera), it bears fruits of all seasons.'

'The trees with huge branches bent down with fruits look like mountains or clouds.'

'Lakshmana will get you the nectarlike fruits either by climbing the trees or by pulling them down.'

'O brave men, pass from hill to hill, forest to forest in great countries until you reach a lake named Pampa.'

' ', 'The slopes of Pampa are without stones or pebbles, O Rama   They are not slippery slopes. They are without moss. The water is neither deep nor shallow. It has smooth beds of sand on the banks and it is full of lotuses and lilies.'

'Moving in the waters of Pampa you will see swans, ducks, krauncha birds and curlews cackling and cooing, O Son of the Raghus.'

'Not knowing that they may be killed, the innocent creatures will not be scared of human beings. Both of you can kill and eat the fat birds comparable to balls of ghee.'

'O Rama, scion of the Raghu dynasty  there at Pampa, by shooting an arrow at the choicest  fishes with a single bone, prawns and big fishes, crookedfaced fishes, fishes without scales and fins, baked on iron skewers and cooked will be offered to you by faithful Lakshmana.'

'While you delightedly eat the fishes, Lakshmana will fetch you water in a lotus leaf from the Pampa to drink. The waters of Pampa full of lotuses carry their scent, It  is enjoyable, cool, healthy and clear, resembling silver and crystal.'

'O best of men you will see huge boars of delightful appearance that roar like bulls resting in mountain caves, roaming in the forest and coming to Pampa for its water.'

'When you stroll in the evening, you will see the trees laden with blossoms and lake Pampa full of cool water. You will forget your grief.'

'O son of the Raghus  there you will see tilaka trees, night jasmines full of flowers. You will also see blossoming water lilies and lotuses in Pampa.'

'There is no one to wear those flowers. Those garlands do not wilt or wither O Rama'

"While drops of sweat from the bodies of sage Matanga's disciples fell on earth under the heavy load of forest products they carried for their preceptor, they remained in a calm state. Those drops of sweat turned into flowers and those flowers do not wither ", 'due to the power of penance of the sages.'

'O Kakutstha  even now their attendant, named Sabari, an old ascetic is there even though they have left long ago.'

'O Rama, she is established in righteousness, and you are godlike, and revered by all beings. When she sees you, she will attain heaven.'

'O Rama of the Kakutstha family, you will see on reaching the western bank of Pampa an incomparable site of hermitage concealed in a remote place. '

'The elephants of the forest and on the mountains do not attack the hermitage forbidden by sage Matanga.'

'O Rama, you will enjoy your stay in that forest which is like Nandana garden, the garden of the gods, full of various birds.'

' ', 'Mount Rishyamuka situated on the bank of Pampa has trees filled with blossoms. It ', 'is difficult to climb and is protected by young elephants.This lofty mountain was created by Brahma in olden days.'

'Whatever wealth one dreams of in sleep on top of that mountain he will get on waking up, O Rama '

'If an evildoer or a sinner ascends the (Rishyamuka) mountain, he, in his sleep, will be thrown down with asleep by the demons from there itself. A sinner does not climb this mountain of uneven terrain.'

"O Rama, the trumpeting of the young playful elephants inhabiting sage Matanga's forest can be heard at Pampa."

'The great, nimble elphants, dark like clouds, drenched with the flow of ichor come together and then separate and scatter.'

'The wandering elephants of the forest drink plentiful water, pure and cool, from Pampa and contented, plunge into the forest.'

'When you see, shining like sapphires, the bears, tigers, antelopes who know no ', 'defeat, you will get over your grief.'

'O son of the Kakutstha family, there is a beautiful cave in that mountain covered with a slab of stone. It is difficult to enter.'

'At the eastern entrance of the cave there is a cool watertank. On its bank teeming with various animals are delightful fruits and roots.'

'Sugriva dwells in that cave with four other monkeys. At times he sits on the top of the mountain.'

'Having instructed both Rama and Lakshmana, courageous Kabandha, wearing a flowergarland, shone brightly like the Sun in the sky.'

'Both Rama and Lakshmana, ready to depart, went near the glorious Kabandha waiting in the sky and said, You may go now.'

'Then Kabandha said to the brothers satisfied, You may go now to accomplish your task. Then he took leave.'

'Kabandha assumed his true form, his body shining like the radiance of the Sun. He stood in the sky showing his form and looking at Rama, said, Make friendship with Sugriva.', 'इत्यार्ष श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे त्रिसप्ततितमस्सर्गः।।', 'Thus ends the seventythird sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.'

'The two princes set forth in the western direction towards Pampa shown by Kabandha.'

'Observing the trees loaded with honeysweet fruits on the mountain, Rama and Lakshmana   went to see Sugriva.'

'Rama and Lakshmana halted on the slope of the mountain and then departed for the western bank of Pampa.'

'Both reached the west bank of lake Pampa and saw the delightful hermitage of Sabari.'

'Both reached the beautiful hermitage full of many kinds of trees. There they saw Sabari, and went towards her.'

'On seeing them both, Sabari, an accomplished ascetic, got up with folded hands and ', 'touched the feet of the sagacious Rama and Lakshmana.'

'She offered them water to wash their feet and water to sip as per tradition. Then Rama spoke to Sabari who used to perform austere penance:'

'O ascetic   hope you have overcome your obstacles to penance, you have controlled your anger and your desire for food. Is your austerity in progress.'

'O Sweettongued Sabari, have you achieved selfcontrol? Has your mind attained peace ? Have your services to the preceptor yielded results?'

'When Rama asked Sabari who was an old, accomplished ascetic adored by siddhas, she stood in front and replied :'

'On seeing you now my penance has attained fulfilment, my services to my preceptors have borne fruit.'

'O best of men, O highest of the gods my birth has become fruitful today with your worship, (you have made) even attainment of heaven quite certain.'

'O delight of the Raghus, your handsome look has sanctified me, O subduer of enemies, by your grace I will reach the inmperishable worlds.'

'The men I served have ascended heaven on aerial chariots of incomparable radiance the moment you touched Chitrakuta.'

"Those great honourable sages who knew the ways of dharma said: 'Rama would visit this sacred hermitage along with Lakshmana. He would be your guest. Receive him ", "with due honour. And you would attain the great, inexhaustible worlds when you see him.'"

'O best among men I have collected and kept for your sake different kinds of forestfood grown on the bank of Pampa.'

'Entreated by her in that manner, the righteous Rama spoke to Sabari who was established in true knowledge:'

'I have heard from great Danu about your power. If you agree, I would like to see this power in person.'

'At these words from the mouth of Rama, Sabari took them both round the great garden.'

'O delight of the Raghus see this garden looking like the dense cloud. Full of animals and birds, it is popularly known as Matanga garden.'

'My precepters, who had perceived the Supreme Spirit made sacrificial offerings in this great garden, invoked gods through the power of mantras. They brought water and offered oblations to the sacrificial fire.'

'This is the altar named Pratyaksthali where the saints aged and exhausted( by performing chandrayana) whom I worshipped made offerings of flowers with trembling hands.'

'O Rama see, even now they illuminate the sacrificial altars with the power of their penance. They shed light in all directions with a matchless brilliance.'

'Look at the seven seas, which have reached here at their mere thought as they could not reach them due to fatigue from fasting.'

'O delight of the Raghus  look at the bark robes spread on the trees to dry after their bathing which are still wet.'

'The flowers including lotuses offered by the sages while worshipping gods have not yet wilted.'

'You have seen the entire garden and have listened what is to be heard. With your permission I would like to give up this body.'

'I wish to reach those realisers of the Supreme Spirit whom I served and to whom this hermitage belonged.'

'Rama and Lakshmana on hearing the pious words of Savari joyfully exclaimed, This is really wonderful.'

'Looking at Sabari who was steadfast in her vow, Rama said, O ascetic, you have worshipped me with devotion. You may go wherever you like (to the world you desire) '

'With matted locks, tattered bark clothes and deer skin, Sabari consigned her old and emaciated body to the fire at that moment, with the permission of Rama and ascended to heaven, her body glowing like fire.'

'Adorned with wonderful ornaments and beautiful garlands, anointed with fragrant unguents, robed in most beautiful clothes, she appeared like a streak of lightning, her body shining bright and her face contented.'

'By virtue of her selfmeditation, Sabari went to that sacred world where the holy sages lived because of their good deeds.', 'इत्यार्ष श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे चतुस्सप्ततितमस्सर्गः।।', 'Thus ends the seventyfourth sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.'

'When Sabari departed for heaven with her brilliance, Rama  contemplated (about the power of sages)with Lakshmana.'

'Thinking about the power of the great sages, righteous Rama said to Lakshmana,  his wellwisher with singleminded devotion:'

'O handsome one, we have seen this highly wonderful hermitage, where deer and tigers dwell together with mutual confidence, where birds of all kinds inhabit.'

'O Lakshmana, having bathed in the waters of the seven seas (by taking ritualistic bath in these waters) the manes are offered oblations in accordance with tradition.'

'We have got rid of inauspicious time and good days have come. Therefore, I feel truly happy. Good fortune will appear (now), O Lakshmana, O tiger among men '

'Come, let us go to Pampa, which is pleasing to look at. Sugriva, the rigteous self, the son of the Sun has been staying for fear of Vali at the shining Rishyamuka, not far from here.'

'I am hastening to see that noble Sugriva the mighty monkey, as the search for Sita depends on him, O handsome one '

'To the words of Rama who was of stable mind, Lakshmana replied : My mind too is hastening me. Let us get there quickly.'

'Then Rama the lord of men along with Lakshmana departed from the hermitage and went to Pampa.'

'He saw the sacred lake Pampa whose sweet flow of water was used by great seers. It abounded in trees and creepers. Its surface was red with lotuses at one place, white with clusters of lilies at another and with blue lotuses at other places. As such, it looked like a carpet with variegated colours.'

'Rama reached the Matanga lake which he could see from  a distance and bathed in it.  '

'Lake Pampa was filled with red lotuses and their fragrance.The bank was lined with blossoming mango trees and trees of several kinds like tilaka trees with fruits full of seeds like citron, dhava trees, white trees in bloom, karavira trees loaded with flowers, punnaga trees, clusters of jasmine and kunda shrubs, fig trees, so also reeds, ashoka trees, atimuktaka creepors and several other trees looking like women adorned all over. Rama and Lakshmana passed by, glancing at them. There were other trees full of flowers, huge trees, koyashtika trees with reed. Different kinds of birds such as peacocks, parrots, dwelling in the forest were screaming aloud. Looking at all these in that forest Rama and Lakshmana passed by undisturbed with a composed mind. '

'Rama saw lake Pampa with cool waters and the groves on the bank filled with tilaka, ashoka, punnaga, bakula and uddala trees.'

'On seeing different kinds of trees and tanks, the lovestriken Rama visited that great lake.'

'There were lovely pleasuregardens in full bloom  filled with sal and champk trees. Honeybees on flowers looked lovely and bright. The waters were crystalclear and fragrant with lotuses.The soft sands on the banks of Pampa gleamed. Rama saw them again and again and described them to Lakshmana.'

'The famous mount, sacred Rishyamuka is situated on the bank of Pampa full of blossoming trees.'

'The mighty son of Riksharaja, the great soul, the Sun whose son was the wellknown Sugriva, resides on this mountain.'

'Rama said to Lakshmana, the best of men, who had truth as his strength, Go to Sugriva, lord of the monkeys.'

'O Lakshmana, deprived of the kingdom I have become a destitute. With my heart attached to Sita how can I live without her ?'

'Having said these words to Lakshmana who was listening to him with undivided attention, Rama, the best of the Raghus, oppressed by love and afflicted by tears of grief entered Pampa, the delightful lotuslake.'

'Thereafter, going slowly to a distance, Rama and Lakshmana saw Pampa surrounded by beautiful forests full of many varieties of birds.', 'इत्यार्ष श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे पञ्चसप्ततिमस्सर्गः।।', 'Thus ends the seventyfifth sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.'
